 the following is a conversation with Gustav Sorum he's the chief research and development officer Spotify leading their product design data technology and engineering teams as I've said before in my research and in life in general I love music listening to it and creating it and using technology especially personalization through machine learning to enrich the music discovery and listening experience that is what Spotify has been doing for years continually innovating defining how we experience music as a society in the digital age that's what Gustav and I talk about among many other topics including our shared appreciation of the movie true romance in my view one of the great movies of all time this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five stars on iTunes support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lux Friedman spelled Fri D ma n and now here's my conversation with Gustav Soros from Spotify has over 50 million songs in its catalogue so let me ask the all-important question I feel like you're the right person to ask what is the definitive greatest song of all time it varies for me personally she can't speak definitively for everyone I wouldn't believe very much in machine learning if I did right because everyone had the same taste so for you what is you have to pick what is the song alright so it's it's pretty easy for me there is this song called you're so cool Hans Zimmer soundtrack to true romance it was a movie that made a big impression on me and it's kind of been following me through my life actually had it play at my wedding I start with the organist and help them play it on an organ which was a pretty pretty interesting experience that is probably my I would say top 3 movie of all time yeah it's just an incredible yeah and then it came out during my formative years and as I've discovered in music you shape your music taste during those years so it definitely affected me quite a bit did it affect you in any other kind of way well the movie itself affected me back then it was a big part of culture I didn't really adopt any characters from the movie about it it was a it was a great story of love fantastic actors and and you know really I didn't even know who Hans Zimmer was at a time but fantastic music and so um that song has followed me and the movie actually follow me throughout my life that was a Quentin Tarantino actually I think director director produced that her so it's not stairway to heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody so those are those are great they're not my personal favorites but uh but they're I realized that people have different tastes and that's it's a big part of what we do well for me I have to stick with stairway to heaven so 35,000 years ago I looked this up on Wikipedia flute like instruments started being used in caves as part of hunting rituals then primitive cultural gatherings things like that this is the birth of music since then we had a few folks Beethoven Elvis Beatles Justin Bieber of course Drake so in your view let's start like high level philosophical what is the purpose of music on this planet of ours I think music has many different purposes I think there's there's certainly a big purpose which is the same as multiple attainment which is ESCA pisum and to be able to live in some sort of other mental state for a while but I also think you have the the opposite of escaping which is to help you focus on something you are actually doing and so I think people use music as a tool to to tune the brain to the activities that they are actually doing and it's kind of like in one sense maybe it's the rawest signal if you if you think about the brain that's known that works it's maybe the most efficient hack we can do to actually actively tune it into some state that you want to be you can do it in other ways you can tell stories to put people in a certain mood but music is probably very F to get to a certain mood very fast and you know there's uh there's a social component historically to music where people listen to music together I was just thinking about this that to me you mentioned machine learning but to me personally music is a really private thing I'm speaking for myself I listen to music like almost nobody knows the kind of things I have in my library except people who are really close to me and they really only know a certain percentage there's like some weird stuff that I'm almost probably embarrassed but by right it's called to give the pleasure everyone I said the guilty pleasures yet hopefully they're not too bad but it's just the ice for me it's personal do you think of music is something that's social or as something that's personal this is a very so I think it's the same it's the same answer that you use it for for both we we've thought a lot about this during these 10 years at Spotify obviously in one sense as you said music is incredibly social you go to concerts and so forth on the other hand it is your your escape and everyone has these things are very personal to them so what we've found is that when it comes to to most people claim that they have a friend or two that they are heavily inspired by and that they listen to so I actually think music is very social but in a smaller group setting it's in it's an intimate form of of it's an intimate relationship it's not something that you necessarily share broadly now at concerts you can argue you do but then you've gathered a lot of people that you have something in common with I think this broadcast sharing on music it's something we tried on social networks and so forth but it turns out that people aren't super interested in is what their friends listen to they're interested in understanding if they have something in common crabs with a friend but not you know not just as information right that that that's really interesting that was just thinking about this morning listening to Spotify I really have a pretty intimate relationship was modified with my playlists right I've had them for many years now and they've grown with me together there's there's an intimate relationship you have with a library of music you've developed and we'll talk about different ways to play with that can you do the impossible task and try to give a history of music listening from your perspective from before the Internet and after the Internet and just kind of everything leading up to streaming Spotify I'll try it it could be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to do a brief version there are some things that that I think are very interesting during the history of music which is that before recorded music you to be able to enjoy music you actually had to be where the music was produced because he couldn't he couldn't record it and time-shifted write creation and consumption had to happen at the same time basically concerts and so you either had to get to the nearest village to listen to music and while that was cumbersome and it severely limited the distribution of music it also had some different qualities which was that the Creator could always interact with the audience it was always live and also there was no time cap on the music so I think it's not a coincident that these early classical works they're much longer than the three minutes the three minutes came in as a restriction of the first wax disc that could only contain a three minute singsong on one side right so actually the recorded music severely limited there or could constraint I won't say limit I mean constraints often good but it put very hard constraints on the music format so you kind of said like instead of doing these this opus like many tens of minutes or something now you get three and a half minutes because then you're out of wax on this disc but in return you get in amazing distribution you reach will widen right just on that point real quick without the mass scale distribution there's a scarcity component where you kind of look forward what we had that it's like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones you like wait for the event because you can't really listen to it see you're like look forward to it and then it's you derive perhaps more pleasure because it's more rare for you to listen to particular piece you think there's value to that scarcity yeah I think that that is definitely a thing and there's always this component of if you have something in infinite amount so will you value it as much probably not humanity is always seeking some is relative so you're always seeking something you didn't have and when you have it you don't appreciate as much I think that's probably true but I think that's why concerts exist so you can actually have both but I think net if you couldn't listen to music in your car driving that that'd be worse that cost will be bigger than the benefit of of the anticipation I think that you would have so yep it started with live concerts then it's being able to you know the the phonograph invented right you start to be able to record music exactly so then then you got this massive distribution that that made it possible to create two things I think first of all cultural phenomenons they probably need distribution to be able to happen but it also opened access to you know for a new kind of artists so you started to have these phenomenons like Beatles inhale this and so forth that would really a function of distribution I think obviously of talent and innovation but there was also taking a component and of course the next big innovation that come along was was radio broadcast radio and I think radio is interesting because it started not as a music medium and started us as an information medium for for news and then radio need to define something to fill the time wid so that they could honestly play more ads and make more money and music was free so so then you had this massive distribution we could program to people I think those things that ecosystem is what created the ability for for for hits but it was also very broadcast medium so you would tend to get these massive massive hits but maybe not such a lot tail in terms of choice of everybody listening to the same stuff yeah and as you said I think there are some social benefits to that yeah I think for example there is there's a high statistical chance that if I talk about the latest episode of Game of Thrones we have something to talk about yeah just statistically in the age of individual choice maybe some of that goes away so I I do see the value of like you know shared cultural components but I also obviously love personalization and so let's catch us up to the Internet so maybe Napster well first of all there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there was a digitalization of music with a CD really it was physical distribution but the music became did you don't yeah and so they were files but basically boxed software and use the software analogy and then you could start downloading these files and I think there are two interesting things that happen back to music used to be longer before it was constrained by the distribution medium I don't think that was a coincidence and then really the only music genre to have developed mostly after music was a file again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is often much longer than the traditional music I think I think it's interesting to think about the fact that music is no longer constrained in minutes per song or something it's it's a it's a legacy of our own distribution technology and you see some of this new music that that breaks the format not so much as I would have expected actually by now but but it still happens so first of all I don't really know what EDM is electronic dance music yeah right you could say Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre so the main constraint is of time something like three four or five minute songs songs there were eight minutes ten minutes and so forth because the you know it started as a digital product that you downloaded so you didn't have this this constraint anymore so I think it's something really interesting that I don't think has fully happened yet we're kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are but I think there's there's tons of formal innovation in music that should happen now that couldn't happen when you needed to really adhere to the distribution constraints if you didn't adhere to that you will get no distribution so so jerk for example Icelandic artist she made a full I pad app as an album that's very expensive you know even though the App Store has great distribution she gets nowhere near the distribution versus staying within the 3-minute format so I think now that music is fully digital inside these streaming services there is there is the opportunity to change the format again and allow creators to be much more creative without limiting their their distribution ability that's interesting that you're right it's surprising we don't see that taking advantage more often it's almost like the constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture to where we want the five three to five minutes on that anything else not just so we want the song as consumers and as artists like I cuz I write a lot of music and I never even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes that's it's really interesting that those constraints because all your training data has been three minutes right it's right okay so yes digitization of data later than mp3s yeah so I think you had this file then that was distributed physically but then you had the components of digital distribution and then the internet happened and there was this vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped but there was no business model and then all these pirate networks happen Napster and in pirate in Sweden Pirate Bay which was one of the biggest and it you know I think from a consumer point of view which which kind of leads up to the inception of of Spotify from a consumer point of view consumers for the first time had this access model to music where they could without kind of any marginal costs they could they could try different tracks you could use music in in new ways there was no marginal cost and that was a fantastic consumer experience that just all the music ever made I think was fantastic but it was all so horrible for artists because there was no business model around it so they didn't make any money so the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model and then there were these download stores that allowed you to download files which was a solution but it didn't solve the access problem there was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track and I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music the example always give this you know in Spotify a huge amount of people listen to music while they sleep while they go to sleep and while they sleep if that costed you $0.99 per three minutes you probably wouldn't do that and you would be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring music so the access model is interesting in that it changes your music behavior you can be you can take much more risk because there's no marginal cost to it maybe let me linger on piracy for a second because I I find especially coming from Russia piracy is something that's very interesting to me not me of course ever but my friends who partook in piracy of music software TV shows sporting events and usually to me what that shows is not that they're they can actually pay the money and they're not trying to save money they're choosing the best experience so what to me piracy shows is a business opportunity in all these domains and that's where I think you're right spot if I stepped in is basically piracy was is an experience you can explore was fine music you like and actually the interface of piracy isn't as horrible because it's I mean it's not metadata yeah that metadata is long download times all kinds of stuff and what Spotify does is basically first rewards artists and second makes the experience of exploring music much better I mean the same is true I think for movies and so on this piracy reveals in the software space for example I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe products and the there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went to a monthly subscription plan and now all of the sudden that you used to pirate Adobe products that I know now actually pay gladly for the monthly subscription I think you're right I think it's in it's a sign of an opportunity for product development and that sometimes the there's a product market fit before there's a business model fit in product development I think that that is that's a sign of it in in Sweden I think was a bit of both there was there was a culture where even had a political party called the pirate party and this was during the time when when people said that you know information should be free it's not was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I think people felt that artists should probably make some money somehow else and you know concerts or something so at least in Sweden it was part really social acceptance even at the political level and that but that also forced Spotify to compete with with free which which I don't think would actually could have happen anywhere else in the world the music industry needed to be doing bad enough to take that risk and Sweden was like a perfect testing ground it had government-funded high-bandwidth low-latency broadband which meant that the product would work and it was also there was no music revenue anyway so they were kind of like I don't think this is going to work but why not so this product is one that I don't think could have happened in America there was large music market for example so how do you compete with free because that's an interesting world of the Internet where most people don't like to pay for things so Spotify steps in and tries to yes compete with free how do you do it so I think two things one is people are starting to pay for things on the Internet I think one way to think about it was that advertising was the first business model because no one would put a credit card on internet transactional with Amazon was the second and maybe subscription is their third and if you look offline subscription is the biggest those so that may still happen I think people are starting to pay but definitely back then we needed to compete with free and the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need to be better somehow and the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience on the on the actual performance the latency of you know even if even if you had high bandwidth broadband it would still take you thirty Seconds to a minute to download one of these tracks so the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy about 250 milliseconds meant that the the whole trick was that felt as if you had downloaded all the part that it was on your harddrive it was that fast even though it wasn't and it was still free but somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen now that was the trick that's what if I managed to to pull off so yeah I've actually heard you say this to write this and that was surprised that wasn't aware of it because I just took it for granted you know whenever an awesome thing comes along you just like of course it has to be this way that that's exactly right that it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because of that of that latency being reduced what was the technical challenge in reducing Olli so there was a group of really really talented engineers one of them called Ludwig freakiest he wrote the actually from Gothenburg he wrote the initial the uterine client which is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify you know that we have one of the top developers from from BitTorrent clients as well so he wrote utorrent the world's smallest BitTorrent clients and then he he was acquired very early by daniel and martin who found it spotify and they actually sold the u torrent client to BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify had a lot of experience within peer-to-peer networking so the original innovation wasn't was a distribution innovation where Spotify built an end-to-end media distribution system up until only a few years ago we actually hosted all the music ourselves so we had both the server side in the cloud and that meant that we could do things such as having a peer-to-peer solution to use local caching on the client-side because back then the world was mostly desktop but we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols things like niggles algorithm for kind of exponential back-off or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize for latency at the cost of bandwidth and all of this end-to-end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a step change these days we actually are on on GCP we don't host our own stuff and everyone is really fast these days so that was the initial competitive advantage but then obviously you have to move on over time and that was I was over 10 years ago right that was in 2008 the product was launched in Sweden it was in a beta I think 2007 and it was on the desktop right so his desktop only there's no phone there was no phone the iPhone came out in 2008 but the App Store came out one year later I think so the writing was on the wall but there was no phone yet you've mentioned that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they liked and then they would torrent those songs just so they can copy it to their phone just hilarious because I'm not torrent quiet it seriously piracy does seem to be and like a good guide for business models video content as far as I know Spotify doesn't have video content well we do have music videos and we do have videos on the on the service but the way we think about ourselves is that we're an audio service and we think that if you look at the amount of time that people spend on audio it's actually very similar to the amount of time that's people spend on video so the opportunity should be equally big but today is not at all valued videos value much higher so we think it's basically completely undervalues we think of ourselves as an audio service but within that audio service I think video can make a lot of sense I think for when you're when you're discovering an artist you probably do want to see them and understand who they are to understand their identity you won't see the video every time now 90% of the time the phone is gonna be in your pocket for podcasters you use video I think that can make a ton of sense so we do have video but we're an audio service where think of it as we call it internally background able video video that is helpful but isn't isn't the driver of the narrative I think also if we look at YouTube the way people there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube so in some sense YouTube was a bit of a competitor to to Spotify which is very strange to me that people use YouTube to listen to music they play essentially the music videos right but don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket well I think I think it's similar to to what strange I mean it's similar to what we were for the piracy networks know where YouTube for historical reasons have a lot of music videos so you use people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part of the process I think but then it's not a really good sort of quote unquote mp3 player because it doesn't even background then you have to keep the app in the foreground so so the consumption on a good consumption tool but it's a decently good discoveries I mean I think YouTube is fantastic products and I use it for all kinds of purposes so if I were to admit something I do use YouTube a little bit for the discovery to assistant discovery process of songs and then if I like it I'll add it just fine that's okay that's okay with that ok so sorry we're jumping around a little bit so the it's kind of incredible you look at Napster you look at the early days of Spotify how do you one fascinating points how do you grow a user base see their ins in Sweden you have an idea I saw the initial sketches that look terrible how do you grow user base from all from a few folks to millions I think there are a bunch of tactical answers so first of all I think you need a great product I don't think you take a bad product and and market it to be successful so you need a great product but sorry to interrupt but it's a totally new way to listen to music too so it's not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product I think they did so back to the point of pyrazine it was a totally new way to listen to music illegally but people had been used to the access model in Sweden and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy so one way to think about Spotify it was just legal and fast piracy yeah and so people have been using it for a long time so they weren't alien to it they didn't really understand how it could be legal because it was seemed too fast and too good to be true yeah which i think is a great product proposition if you can be too good to be true but what I saw again and again was people showing each other clicking the song showing how fast it started and saying I can't believe this yeah so I really think it was about speed then we also had an invite product program that was there was really meant for scaling because we hosted our own service we needed as a control scaling but that built a lot of expectation and I don't want to say hype because I hype implies that it was that it wasn't true excitement around the product and we've replicated that when we launched in the in the US we also built up and it might only program first there are lots of tactics but I think you need a you need a great product that solves some problem and B basically the key innovation there was technology but on a method level the innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model and that was tricky a lot of people said that they I mean they wanted to own their music they would never kind of rent it or borrow it but I think the fact that we had a free tier which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well helped quite a lot so this is an interesting psychological point maybe you can speak to it was a big shift for me like I get to it's almost like a I go to therapy for this is uh I think I would describe my early listening experience and I think a lot of my friends do is basically hoarding music is your like slowly one song by one song or maybe albums gathering a collection of music that you love and you own it it's like awful especially with CDs or tape you like physically had it and and what Spotify what I had to come to grips with it was kind of liberating actually is to throw away all the music I've had this therapy session yes people and I think the mental trick is so actually we seen the user data once what if I started a lot of people did the exact same thing they started hoarding as if the music would disappear right almost the equivalent of downloading and so you know we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand tracks which we no one will ever like well they do needs and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks and to this day you know some people want to actually save code and coordinate play the entire catalog but I think that the therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music if you took your files and you store them in the locker at Google it'd be a streaming service it's just that in that locker you have all the world's music now for free so instead of giving away your music you got all the music it's yours it's a you could think of it at having a copy of the world's catalogue that forever so you actually got more music instead of less it's just that you just took that hard disk and you sent it to to someone who stored it for you and once you go through that mental journey I'm like still my files they're just over there and I just have 40 million other 50 million or something now then people are like okay that's good the problem is I think because you paid us a subscription if we hadn't had the free tier where you would feel like even if I don't want to pay anymore I still get to keep them you keep your playlist forever they don't disappear even though you stopped paying I think that was really important if we would have started us you know you can put in all this time but if you stopped paying you lose all your work I think that would have been a big challenge and what's the big challenge for a lot of our competitors that's another reason why I think the free tier is really important that people need to feel the security that the work they put in it will never disappear even if they decide not to pay I like how you put the work you put in I she stopped even think of it that way I just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music I'm sorry as opposed as opposed to what I was doing before which is like in an unhealthy way hoarding music which I found that because I was doing that I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to our where I was getting sick of them whereas Spotify the more liberating kind of approaches I was just enjoying of course I listened to stairway to heaven over and over but because of the extra variety I don't get as sick of them there is an interesting statistic I saw that so Spotify has maybe you can correct me but over 50 million songs tracks and over three billion playlists so yes a million songs and three billion playlists 60 times more playlists what do you make of that yeah so the way I think about it is that from a from is that the station or machine learning point of view you have all these if you only thing about reinforcement learning where you have this state space of all the tracks and you can take different journeys through this through this world and these I think of these is like people helping themselves and each other creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks and then it's not so surprising that across you know many tens of millions of kind of atomic units there will be billions of paths that make sense and we're probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them so kind of our job now is users when Spotify started it was really a search box that was for that time pretty powerful and then I'd like to refer to that this programming language called play listing where if you as you probably were pretty good at music you knew your new releases you knew your backyard law you knew your stairway to heaven you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlist thing - oh that's like meta programming language for music - sounds like your life and people who were good at music it's back to how do you scale the product for people who are good at music that wasn't actually enough if you had the catalog in a good search tool and you can create your own sessions you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself but the problem was most people many people aren't that good at music they just can't spend the time even if you're very good at news it's gonna be hard to keep up so what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build you can think of them as a instead there's this friend that some people had that helped them navigate this music catalog that's what we're trying to do for you but also there is something like 200 million active users on Spotify so there it's okay so from the machine learning perspective you have these 200 million people plus they're creating it's really interesting to think of playlist as I mean I don't know if you meant it that way but it's almost like a programming language it's a released a trace of exploration of those individual agents of the the listeners and you have all this new tracks coming in so it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning so that is there is it is it possible how can playlist be used as data in terms of machine learning and just to help Spotify organize the music so we found in our data not surprising that people who play listed lots they retain much better they had a great experience and so our first attempt was to playlist for users and so we acquired this company called tune ego of editors and professional playlist errs and kind of leverage the maximum of human intelligence to help to help build kind of these vectors through the track space for four people and that that broaden the product then the obvious next and we you know use statistical means where they could see what when they created a playlist how did that play this perform you know they could see skips of the songs they could see how the songs perform and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people but there were never enough editors to playlist for you personally so the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization using editors and tools into statistics to individualization and then what's so interesting about the 3 billion playlist we have is we ended the truth is we lucked out this was not a priori strategy as is often the case it looks really smart in hindsight was as dumb luck we looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company a person named their grandson it was really good at machine learning already back in in back then in like 2007-2008 back then it was mostly collaborative filtering you so forth but we realized that what what this is is people are grouping tracks for themselves that have some semantic meaning to them and then they actually label it with a playlist name as well so in a sense people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them and so could you could you use that information to find that that latent embedding and so we started playing around with collaborative filtering and we saw tremendous success with it basically trying to extract some of these some of these dimensions and and if you think about it's not surprising at all it'd be quite surprising if playlists were actually random if they had no semantic meaning for most people they group these tracks for some reason so we just happen to cross this incredible data set where people are taking taken these tens of millions of tracks and group them along different semantic vectors and the semantics being outside the individual users it's some kind of universal there's a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth yes I do think that the embeddings you finally gonna be reflective of the people who play listed so if if you have a lot of indie lovers who playlist your embed is going to perform better there but what we found was that yes there were these these latent similarities they were very powerful and we we had them it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most initially were this so-called music aficionados who who really into music and they often had a certain they're tasteful stuff is often certain geared towards a certain type of music and so what surprised us if you look at the problem from the outside you might expect that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream tastes than really particular tastes it was the complete opposite for us the recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as having very unique taste that's probably because all of them playlist ed and they didn't perform so well for mainstream is they actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox so we had the complete opposite of what we expected success within the hardest problem first and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations so you've also acquired echo nests that analyze a song data so in your view maybe you can talk about so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective there's a like a huge amount what we're talking about playlists thing and just user data of what people are listening to the playlists are constructing and so on and then there's the the actual data within a song what makes a song I don't know the actual waveforms right is there any how do you mix the two how much values are in each to me it seems like user data is well it's a romantic notion that the song itself would contain useful information but if I were to guess user data would be much more powerful like playlists would be much more powerful yeah so we use both our biggest success initially what was with playlist data without understanding anything about the structure of this song but when we acquire the echo nest they had the inverse problem they actually didn't have any play data they were just they were a provider of recommendations but they didn't actually have any play data so they they looked at the structure of songs sonically and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth right cool and did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got that skill into the company and combine kind of our user data with their with their kind of content-based so you can think of as we were used to based and they were content based in their recommendations and we combine those two and for some cases where you have a new there's no no play date obviously you have to try to go by either you know who the artist is or or the sonic information in the song or what it's similar to so there's definitely value in in both and we do a lot in both but I would say yes the user data captures things that that have to do with culture in the greater society that you would never see in the in the content itself but that said we have seen we have a research lab in Paris when you know we can talk about more about that on kind of machine layer on the creator side what it can do for creators not just for the consumers but where we looked at how does the structure of a song actually affect the listening behavior and it turns out that there is a lot of we can we can predict things like skips based on we you know based on on the song itself we could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit because you're skippers gonna go up here there is a lot of latent structure in the music which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack so there should be structured that's probably what we respond to you just blew my mind actually for from the creator perspective so that's really interesting topic that probably most creators aren't taking advantage of right so there's I've recently got to interact with a few folks youtubers who are like obsessed with this idea of what do I do to make sure people keep watching the video and then like look at the analytics of which point if people turn off and so on first of all don't think that's healthy but it's it's because you can do it a little too much but it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process you just made me realize you could do the same thing for creation of music and so is that something you've looked into oh is it can you speak to how much opportunity there is for that yeah I think I listen to to the podcast with Suraj yeah and I thought it was fantastic and directed to do the same thing where he said and he said he posted something in the morning yeah immediately watch the feedback where the drop off was and then responded to that in the afternoon yeah which which is quite different from how people make podcasts for example yes exactly I mean the feedback loop is almost non-existent it's very so if we back out a one-level I think actually both for music and podcasts which we also do is let Spotify I think there's a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow and I think it's really interesting speaking to you who because you're a musician a developer and a podcaster if you think about those three different roles if you if you make the leap as a musician if you if you think about it as a software tool chain really your door with the stems that's the IDE right that's what you work in source code formant with your with with what you're creating then you sit around and you play with that and when you're happy you compile that thing into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 or something you do that because you get distribution there's so many runtimes for that mp3 across the world and Carstairs and stuff so you kind of compile this executable you ship it out and kind of an old fashioned box software analogy and then you hope for the best right right but as a as a as a software developer you'd never do that first you go and get helping you collaborate with other Creators yeah and then you know you think it'd be crazy to just ship one version of your software without doing an a/b test without any feedback loop and then HD tracking exactly and then you would you would look at the feedback loops and try to optimize that thing right so I think if you think of it as a as a very specific software tool chain it looks quite arcane you know the tools that a music creator has versus what a software developer has so that's kind of how we think about it and why wouldn't a why wouldn't a music creator have something like github you could collaborate much more easily so we have we bought this company called sound trap which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach where you can collaborate with other people on the kind of source code format with stamps and I think introducing things like AI tools there to help you as you're creating music both in in helping you you know put accompaniment your music like drums or something help you master and mix automatically help you understand how this track will perform exactly what you would expect as a software developer I think makes a lot of sense and I think the same goes for a podcaster I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop that Siraj has like why wouldn't you maybe maybe it's not healthy but sorry I wanted to criticize the fact cuz you can overdo it because a lot of the each and we're in a new era of that so you can become addicted to it and therefore what people say you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm are sort of it's a it's always a danger of a new technology as opposed to say if you're creating a song becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song that keeps people listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process it's a balance absolutely but the fact that there's zero I mean you're blowing my mind right now because you're completely right that there is no signal whatsoever there's no feedback whatsoever in the creation process and music or podcasting almost at all and are you saying that Spotify is hoping to help create tools to not tools but no tools actually actually tools from traders absolutely so we have we've remains micro stations the last few years around music creation this company called soundtrap which is the door digital audio workstation but that is browser-based and that their focus was really the Google Docs approach where you can collaborate with people much more easily then you could in previous tools so we have some of these tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible and then we can connect it with our with our consumption data we can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand we could help you create and help you understand how you will perform we also acquired this other company within podcasting called anchor which is one of the biggest podcasting tools mobile focused so really focused on simple creation or easy access to create but that also gives us this feedback loop and even before that we invested in something called Spotify for artists and Spotify for podcasters which is an app that you can download you can verify that you are that creator and then you get you get things that you know software developers have had for years you can see where if you look at your podcast for example on Spotify or or a song that you released you can see how it's performing which cities is performing and who is listening to it what's the demographic break up so similar in the sense that you can understand how you're actually doing on the on the platform so we we definitely want to build tools I think you also interviewed the head of research for Adobe and I think that's an item back to photoshop that you like I think that's an interesting analogy as well Photoshop I think has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists and I think there should be the same kind of tools for for music creators where you could get you know AI assistants for example that's you creating music as you can do with with Adobe where you can I want to sky over here and you can get help creating that sky the really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't have is a distribution for the content you create so you don't have the data of if I create if I uh you know whatever creation I'm making Photoshop a premiere I can't get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube for example about the way people are responding and if Spotify is creating those tools that that's a really exciting actually world but let's talk a little about podcast it's so I have trouble talking to one person so it's a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom but an average sixty to a hundred thousand people will listen to this episode okay so it's intimidating it's intimidating so I hosted on blueberry I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly actually it looks like most people listen to an Apple podcast cashbox and pocket gas and only about a thousand listen on Spotify in just my podcast right so where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this so Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting talk nesting site yeah in podcasting what's the deal with podcasting and Spotify how serious is Spotify about podcasting do you see a time where everybody would listen to you know probably a huge amount of people majority perhaps listen to music on Spotify do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting well I certainly hope so that is our mission our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art in a billion people inspired by it and what I think it is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the crater's first even though it's not as a consumer focused company and it says to be able to live off of their art not just make some money or further art as well so it's quite an ambitious project and so we think about creators of all kinds and we kind of expanded our mission from being music - being audio a while back and that's not so much because we think we made that decision we think that my decision was was made for us we need the world made that decision whether we like it or not when you put in your headphones you're gonna make a choice between music and new episode of of your podcast or something else right we're in that world whether we like it or not and that you know that's how radio work so we decided that we think it's about audio you can see the rise of audiobooks and so forth we think audio is this great opportunity so we decided to enter it and and obviously Apple and Apple podcast is absolutely dominating in podcasting and we didn't have a single podcast only like two years ago what we did though was we we we looked at this and said no can we bring something to this you know we want to do this but the back to the Josefa we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to do this and the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being the the record of what quite a wide margin the second-largest podcast consumption still still wide gap to iTunes but we're growing quite fast I think it's because when we when we looked at the consumer problem people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the same in the same application so what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach what we said instead of building a separate podcast app we thought it's their consumer problem to solve here because the others are very successful already and we thought there was in making a more seamless experience where you can have your podcast in your music in the same application because we think it's audio to you and that that has been successful and that meant that we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from 0 so I think we have a good chance because we're taking a different approach than the competition and back to the other thing I mentioned about creators because we're looking at the end-to-end flow I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a format when we have creation tools and consumption I think we could start improving what podcasting is I mean podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2 hour file that you're streaming which it really doesn't make that much sense in 2019 that it's not interactive there's no feedback loops nothing like that so I think if we're gonna win it's gonna have to be because we build a better product for creators and for for consumers so we'll see but it's certainly our goal we have a long way to go well the creators part is really exciting you ready you got me hooked there is the only stats I have a blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it's listened to the end or not and that's like a huge improvement but that's still nowhere to where you could possibly go into her statistics you just download this pot of five podcasters up and verify and then then you know where people dropped out in this episode oh wow ok the moment I started talking okay I might be depressed by this but okay so one one other question the original Spotify for music and I have a question about podcasting in this line is the idea of albums I have what did you use ik aficionados a friends who are really big fans of music often really enjoy albums listening to entire albums of an artist and correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like Spotify has helped replace the idea of an album with playlists so you create your own albums it's kind of the way at least I've experienced music and I have really enjoy it that way one of the things that was missing in podcasting for me I don't know if it's missing I don't know it's an open question for me but the way I listen to podcasts is the way I would listen to albums so I take Joe Rogan experience and that's an album and I listen you know I like I put that on and I listen one episode after the next and there's a sequence and so on is there a room for doing what you did for music or doing what about if I did for music but creating playlists sort of this kind of play listing idea of breaking apart from podcasting from individual podcasts and creating kind of this interplay or Debbie thought about that space it's a great question so I think in in music you're right basically you bought an album so it was like you bought a small catalog of like 10 tracks right it was it was again it was actually a lot of a lot of consumption you think it's about what you like but it's based on the business model right so you paid for this 10 track yeah service and then you listened to that for a while and then when everything was flat priced you tended to listen differently now so so I think the I think the album is still tremendously important that's why we have it and you can save albums and so forth and you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums and I like that because it is a creator format you can tell a longer story over several tracks and so some people listen to just one track some people actually want to hear that whole story now in podcast I think I think it's different you can argue that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix you have like a full season of of narcos and you're probably not going to do like one episode of Marcos and then one of house of cards like you know that there's a narrative there and you you you love the cast and you love these chairs so I think people will people love shows and I think they will they will listen to those shows I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time so there's certainly an opportunity to bring you the latest episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10 things that that you're into but but I think I think people are gonna listen to specific hosts and love those hosts for a long time because I think there's something different with podcast where this format of the the experience of the of the audience is actually sitting here right between us whereas if you look at something on TV the audio actually would come from you would sit over there the order would come to you from both of us as if you were watching notice you were part of the conversation so my experience is I mean listen to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all of these people they they have no idea who I am but I feel like you know so many artists and that it's very different from me watching a watching like a TV show or an interview so I think you you kind of fall in love with people and experience in a different way so I think I think shows and hosts are gonna be very very important I don't think that's gonna go away in just some sort of thing where well you don't even know who you're listening to I don't think that's gonna happen what I do think is I think there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in podcast because the catalog is growing quite quickly and I think podcast is only a few like five six hundred thousand shows right now if you look back to YouTube as another in knowledge of creators no one really knows if you would lift the lid on YouTube but it's probably billions of episodes and so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously because the creation tools are getting easier and then you're gonna have this discovery opportunity that I think is really big so so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows but discovering podcasts kind of suck it's really hard to get into new show they're usually quite long it's a big time investments I think there's plenty of opportunity in the discovery part yeah for sure a hundred percent in in even the dumbest there's so many low-hanging fruit too for example just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast exactly because most podcasts don't have an order to them they they can be listening to out of order and sorry to say some are better than others episodes so some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others and it's nice to know which you should listen to to try it out and there's as far as I know almost no information in terms of like up votes on how good an episode is exactly so I think part of the problem is you it's kind of like music there isn't one answer people use music for different things and there's actually many different types of music there's workout music and there's classical piano music and focus music and and and so forth I think the same with podcasts some podcasts are sequential they're supposed to be listened to in in order it's actually it's actually telling a narrative some podcasts are one topic kind of like yours but different guests so you could jump in anywhere some potes I have completely different topics and for those podcasts it might be that I want you know we should recommend one episode because it's about AI yeah from someone but then they talk about something that you're not interested in the rest of the episodes so I think or well we're spending a lot of time on now it's just first understanding the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how do people consume and I think we'll find that it's gonna be it's gonna be different I'm excited is it your the Spotify is the first people I'm aware of that are trying to do this for podcasting podcasting has been like a Wild West up until now it's been a very we want to be very careful though because it's been a very good Wild West I think is this fragile ecosystem and I you we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like oh we're gonna internalize this thing and you have to think about the the creators you have to understand how they get distribution today who listens to how they make money today started you know make sure that their business model works that they understand the I think it's back to doing something improving their products like feedback loops and distribution so jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of recommender system and listening to music and using machine learning to analyze things do you think it's better to what currently correct me if I'm wrong but currently Spotify lets people pick what they listen to the most part there's a discovery process but you kind of organize playlists is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen to something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you're playing around with maybe you can tell me what's the status of that this is a Pandora style app that just kind of as opposed to you select the music you listen to it kind of feeds you music you listen to what's the status of stations by Spotify what's its future the store is modify as we have grown has been that we made it more accessible to different different audiences and stations is another one of those where the question is some people want to be very specific they actually want to hear stairway to heaven right now that needs to be very easy to do and some people or even the same person at some point might say I want to feel up beats or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car alright so they put in they put in the information in a very different level and then we need to translate that into that what that means musically so stations is a test to to create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you can just tune in a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach but we're trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super-advanced so-called music aficionados all the way to to people who they love listening to music but it's it not their number-one priority in life right they're not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist they need to be able to to influence music at a at a at a different level so we're trying you can think of it as different products and I think when one of them one of the interesting things to answer your question on if it's better to lift the user to soar to play I think the answer is the the challenge when you when machine learning kind of came along there was a lot of thinking about what this product development mean in a machine learning context people like Andrew Aang for example when I went to buy do I started doing a lot of practical machine learning went from academia and you know he thought a lot about this and he had this notion that you know product manager designer an engine they used to work around this wireframe I kind of described what the product should look like who some talk about when you're doing like a chatbot or a playlist how do you what are you gonna say like it should be good that's not a good product description so how do you how do you do that he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe the the job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of what like if you say like I want to play the status songs missing in the car job the product managers go in source like a good test out of what that means then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that right so we try to think a lot about how to structure product development for for a machine learning age and and what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation and you can go you can go two ways so let's say that if you if you set the expectation with the user that this is a discovery product like discover weekly you're actually setting the expectation that most of all we show you will not be relevant when you're in the discovery process you're gonna accept that actually if you find one gem every Monday that you totally love you're probably gonna be happy even though the statistical meaning one out of ten is terrible or one out of twenty is terrible from a user point of view because the studying was discoveries fine can I get a sorry to interrupt real quick I just actually learned about discover weekly which is a Spotify I don't know it's it's a feature a Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen I maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't find them my Spotify app it's in your library it's in the library it's in the list of life cuz I was like whoa is just cool I didn't know this existed and I try to find it but I'll show it to you back product yeah but yeah it's a so yes I just uh just to mention the expectation there is basically they you're going to discover in your song yes so then you can be quite adventurous in in the recommendations you do but but if you're but we have another product called daily mix which kind of implies that these are only going to be your favorites so if you have one out of ten that is good and nine out of ten that doesn't work for you you're gonna think it's a horrible product so actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years it's about setting the right expectation so for daily mix you know algorithmically we would pick among things that feel very safe in your taste space there's discover weekly we go kind of well because the expectation is most of this is not gonna so a lot of that a lot of times of your question there a lot of should you let the user pick or not it depends we have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play put the phone in the pocket and it should be really good music for like an hour we have other products where you probably need to say like no no say no no and it's very interactive I see that makes sense and then the radio product the station's product is one of these like click Play put in your pocket four hours that's really interesting so you're thinking of different test sets for differ users interact create products that sort of optimize optimize for those test sets that represents a specific set of users yes I think one thing that I think is interesting is we we invested quite heavily in editorial in in people creating playlists using a statistical data and I was successful for us and then we also invested in in machine learning and for the longest time you know within Spotify and within the rest of the industry there was always this narrative of humans versus the machine how go versus editorial and an editors would would say like well if I had that data if I could see your playlist in history and I made a choice for you I would have made a better choice and they would have because they honest they're much smarter than these algorithms the human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms they can take culture into account and so forth the problem is that they can't make 200 million decisions you know per hour for every user that logs in so the algo may be not as sophisticated but much more efficient so there was this there was this contradiction but then a few years ago we started focusing on this kind of human-in-the-loop thinking around machine learning and we actually coined an internal term for it called algo toriel combination of algorithms and and editors where if we take a concrete example you think of the editor there's this paid expert that we have there's really good at something like so hip-hop EDM something right there a true expert no and one in the industry so they have all the cultural knowledge you think of them as the product manager and you say that let's say that you want to create a you think that there's a there's a product need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or someone sitting in the shower and I'm taking that example because it exists people love yeah The Scream songs in the car when they drive right yeah so you want to create that product and you have this product manager if it's a musical expert they create they come up with a concept like I think this is a missing thing in in humanity like upside it's called song sitting in the car they they create the framing the image the title and they create a test set or they create a group of songs like a few thousand songs out of the catalogue that they manually curate that our known songs that are great to sing in the car and they can take like to romance into account they understand things that our algorithms do not at all so they have this huge set of tracks then when we deliver that to you we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing in the car in your taste so you have you have personalization and editorial input in the same process if that makes sense yeah it makes total sense and I have several questions around that this is a this is like fascinating okay so first it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming machines at specifying songs to sing in the car so maybe you could talk to that a little bit I don't know if you can put it into words but what is it how difficult is this problem of tea do you really I guess what I'm trying to ask is there how difficult is it to encode the cultural references the the context of the song the artists all those things together can machine learning really not do that I mean I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the patterns but if you try to write with me a spec of what songs greatest song testing in the card definition is is it is it loud there's many choruses should've been in movies it's it quickly gets incredibly complicated right yeah and and a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title it could be cultural references because you know it was a history once so so the definition problems quickly get and I think that was the that was the insight of Andrew Aang when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that that algorithms don't and then define what that looks like and then you have something to train towards right then you have kind of the test set and then so so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize you could easily imagine that once you have this set you could have some automatic exploration on the rest of the catalogue because then you understand what it is and then the other side of it what machine learning does help is this taste vector how hard is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human likes it this human preference so you can you know music isn't like it's not like Amazon like things you usually buy music seems more amorphous like it's this thing that's hard to specify like what what is what you know if you look at my playlist what is the music that I love it's harder it seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely so how hard is it to a build the taste vector it is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data and I think what we found was that so it's not so it's not a stationery problem most it changes over time and so we've gone through the journey of if you've done a lot of computer vision obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision in my past and and we started kind of with the handcrafted heuristics for you know this is kind of in the music this is this and if you consume this you probably like this so we have we started there and we have some of that still then what was interesting about the playlist data was that you could find these latent things that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you that could could even capture maybe cultural references because they Co occurred things that they wouldn't have appeared mechanistically either in the content or so forth so I think that I think the core assumption is that there are patterns in in almost everything and if there are patterns these these embedding techniques are getting better and better now if now as everyone else we're also using kind of deep embedding so you can encode binary values and so forth and what I think is interesting is is this process to try to find things that they do not necessarily you wouldn't actually have have guessed so it is very hard in a in an engineering sense to find the dimensions it's an incredible scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to update it every day but in but in theory in theory embeddings isn't that complicated the fact that you try to find some principal components or some like that dimensionality reduction is also the theory I guess is easy that the practices is very very hard and it's a it's a huge engineering challenge but fortunately we have some amazing research and engineering teams in this space yeah I guess the the question is all I mean it's similar I deal with it with an autonomous vehicle spaces the question is how hard is driving and here is basically the question is of edge cases so embedding probably works not probably but I would imagine works well in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of questions that arise then so do song preferences does your taste vector depend on context like mood right so there's different moods and absolutely so how does that take in is it is it possible to take that at consideration or do you just leave that as a interface problem that allows the user to just control it so when I'm looking for workout music I kind of specify it by choosing certain players doing certain search yeah so that's a great point it's back to the product development you could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you're in automatically open Spotify or you create a tab which is happy and sad right and you're gonna be right 100% of the time with one click now it's probably much better to let the user tell you if they're happy or sad or if they want to work out on the other hand if you use the interface become 2,000 tabs you're introducing so much friction so no one will use the product so then you have to get better so it's this thing where I think it maybe was I remember who coined it but it's called fault tolerant you is right you build the UI that is tolerant of being wrong and then you can be much less right in your you know in your algorithms so we you know we've had to learn a lot of that building the right UI that fits where the where the machine learning is and and a great discovery there which is which was by the teams during one of our hack days was this thing of taking discovery packaging it into a playlist and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might like based on this and studying the right expectation made it made it a great product so I think we have this benefit that for example Tesla doesn't have that we can we can we can change the expectation we can we can build a fault-tolerant setting it's very hard to be fault tolerant when you're driving at you know 100 miles per hour or something and and we we have the luxury of being able to say that of being wrong if we have the right UI which gives us different abilities to take more risk so I actually think the self-driving problem is is much harder oh yeah for sure it's much less fun because people die exactly and in Spotify it's just such a more fun problem because failure will mean failures beautiful away at least exploration so it's a really fun reinforcement learning project the worst case scenario is to get these WTF tweets like how did I get this this song which is a lot better than the self-driving favor so what's the feedback that a user puts the signal that a user provides into the system so the the you mentioned skipping what is like the strongest signal is uh you didn't mention clicking like so so we have a few signals that are important obviously playing playing through so so one of the benefits of music actually even compared to podcast or or movies is the object itself is really only about three minutes so you get a lot of chances to recommend and the feedback loop is is every three minutes instead of every two hours or some things you actually get kind of noisy but but quite fast feedback and so you can see if people played through or if they which is you know the inverse of skip really that an important signal on the other hand much of the consumption happens when your phone is in your pocket maybe you're running or driving or you're playing on a speaker and so you not skipping doesn't mean that you love that song it might be that it wasn't bad enough that you would walk up and skip so it's a noisy signal then then we have the equivalent of the like which is you saved it to your library that's a pretty strong signal of affection and then we have the more explicit signal of play listing like you took the time to create a playlist you put it in there there's a very little small chance that if you took all that trouble this is not a really important track to you and then we understand also what are the tracks it relates to so we have we have the playlist thing we have the like and then we have the listening or skipped and you have two very different approaches to all of them because at different levels of noise one one is very voluminous but noisy and the others rare but you can you can probably trust it yeah it's interesting I think between those signals captures all the information you'd want to capture I mean there's a feeling a shallow feeling for me that there's sometimes I'll hear songs like yes this is you know this was the right song for the moment but there's really no way to express that fact except by listening through it all the way yeah and maybe playing it again at that time or something yeah there's no need for a button that says this was the best song I could have heard at this moment well we're playing around with that with kind of the thumbs up concept saying like I really like this just kind of talking to the algorithm it's unclear if that's the best way for you miss to interact maybe it is maybe they should think of Spotify has a person an agent sitting there trying to serve you and you can say like that's modified good Spotify right now the analogy we've had is more you shouldn't think of us we should be invested oh and the feedback is if you save it it's kind of you work for yourself you do a playlist because you think is great and we can learn from that it's kind of back to back to Tesla how they kind of have that shadow mode they sit in what you drive we kind of took the same analogy we stayed in watch your playlist and then maybe we can we can offer you an autopilot where you can take over for a while or something like that and then back off if you say like that's not that's not good enough but but I think it's interesting to figure out what your mental model s if Spotify is an AI that you talk to which I think might be a bit too abstract for for many consumers or if you still think of it as it's my music app but it's just more helpful and depends on the device it's running on which brings us to smart speakers so I have a lot of the Spotify listening I do is on things like on device they can talk to you whether it's from Amazon Google or Apple what's the role Spotify on those devices how do you think of it differently then on the phone or on the desktop there are few things to say about the first of all it's incredibly exciting they're growing like crazy especially here in the in the in the US and it's solving a consumer need that I think is is you can think of it as just remote interactivity you can control this thing from from from across the room and it might may feel like a small thing but it turns out that friction matters to consumers being able to say play pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful so basically you made you made the living room interactive now and what we see in our data is that the the number one use case for these speakers is music music and podcasts so fortunately for us it's been important to these companies to have those use case covered so they wanted Spotify on this we have very good relationships with with them and we're seeing we're seeing tremendous success for them what what I think it's interesting about them is it's already working with we kind of had this epiphany many years ago back when we started using Sonos if you went through all the trouble of setting up your sonar system you had this magical experience where you had all the music ever made in your living room and and we we we made this assumption that the home everyone use that a CD player at home but they never managed to get their files working in the home having this network attached which was too cumbersome for most consumers so we made the assumption that the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming books where where you will get would by the steering without all the music built-in that took longer than we thought but with the voice speakers that was the unlocking that made kind of the connected speaker happen in the home so so it really it really exploded and we saw this engagement that we predicted would happen what I think is interesting though is where it's going from now right now you think of them as voice speakers but I think if you look at Google i/o for example they just added a camera to it where you know when the alarm goes off instead of saying hey Google stop you can just wave your hand so I think they're gonna think more of it as a as an agent or as an assistant truly an assistant and an assistant that can see you it's gonna be much more effective than then a blind assistant so I think these things will morph and we won't necessarily think of them as quote-unquote voice speakers anymore just as interactive access to the Internet in the home but I still think that the biggest use case for those will be will be audio so for that reason we're investing heavily in it and we've built our own NLU stack to be able to the the challenge here is how do you innovate in that well it's it's it lowers friction for consumers but it's also much more constrained there you have no pixels to play with in an in an audio-only world it's really the vocabulary that is the interface so we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that trying to understand what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music and actually you're actually nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from everything I've seen the level of frustration people experience upon failure of natural language understanding is much higher than failure in other content people get frustrated really fast so if you screw screw that experience up even just a little bit they give up really quickly yeah and I think you see that in the data while well it's tremendously successful the most common interactions are play pause and you know next the things were if you compare it to taking up your phone unlocking you bringing up the app and skipping clicking skip yeah it was it was much lower friction but then for for longer more complicated things like you if I mean that song about people stopping up the phone and search and then play it on their speaker so we tried again to build a fault-tolerant UI where for the more for the more complicated things you can still pick up your phone have powerful full keyboard search and then try to optimize for whether it's actually lower friction and try to it's it's kind of like the test autopilot thing you have to be at the level where you're helpful if you're too smart and just in the way people are gonna get frustrated and first of all I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven it's just a good song but let me mention that as a use case because it's an interesting one I've literally told one of I don't want to say the name of the speaker cuz though when people are listening to it'll make their speaker go off but I talk to the speaker and I say play stairway to heaven and every time it like not every time but a large percent of the time plays the wrong stairway to heaven it plays like some cover of the and that that part of the experience I actually wonder from a business perspective the Spotify control that entire experience or no it seems like the NLU the the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then Spotify stays at a layer below that it is a good and complicated question some of which is dependent on the on the partner so it's hard to comment on the own specifics but the question is the right one the challenges if you can't use any other personalization I mean we know which stairway to heaven and and the truth is maybe for for one person it is exactly the cover that they want and they will be very frustrated if a place I I think we I think we default to the right version but but you actually want to be able to do the cover for the person that just played the cover 50 times or Spotify is just gonna seem stupid so you want to be able to leverage the personalization but you have this stack where where you have the the ASR and this thing called the N best list so then that guesses here and then the presentation comes in at the end you actually want the personalization to be here when you're guessing about what they actually meant so we're working with these partners and it's a complicated it's a complicated thing where you want to you want to be able so first of all you want to be very careful with you users data you don't share your users data without the permission but you want to share some data so that their experience gets better so that these partners can understand enough but not too much and so forth so it's really the trick is that it's like a business driven relationship where you're doing product development across companies together yeah which is which is really complicated but this is exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalized guesses because this is the biggest frustration from a user point of view they don't understand about ASRs and n best lists and and business deals they're like how hard can it be I've told this thing 50 times in this version and still applies the wrong thing it can't it can't be hard so we try to take the user approach if the user the users not going to understand the complications of business we have to solve it let's talk about sort of a complicated subject that I myself I'm quite torn about the idea of sort of paying artists right I saw as of August 31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were paid to rights holders so and further distributed to artists from Spotify so a lot of money is being paid to artists first of all the whole time is a consumer for me when I look at Spotify I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly but I think you said exactly how I feel which is this is too good to be true like when I started using Spotify I assume you guys will go bankrupt in like a month it's like this is too good a lot of people did like this is amazing so one question I have is sort of the bigger question how do you make money in this complicated world how do you deal with a relationship with record labels who are complicated these big you're essentially and have the task of herding cats but like rich and powerful cats and also have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough and still making money in the internet space or people are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars a month so how do you navigate the space how do you know that's a beautiful description hurting rich cats yeah that's before it is very complicated and I think certainly actually betting against Porter fire has been statistically a very smart thing to do just looking at the at the line of roadkill in music streaming services it's it's kind of I think if I had understood the complexity when I joined Spotify unfortunately fortunately I didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities because then I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn't work so you know ignorant is bliss but I think there have been a few distinct challenges I think as I said one of the things that made it work at all was that Sweden and the Nordic was a lost market so there was you know there was there was no risk for labels to try this I don't think it would have worked if if the market was was healthy so so that was the initial condition then then we had this tremendous challenge with the model itself so now most people were pirating but for the people who bought a download or CD the artists will get all the revenue for all the future plays then right so you got it all up front whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing they want almost nothing they - and then at some point this curve of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one payment and that took a long time to play out before before the music labels they understood that but on the other side it took a lot of time to understand that actually if I have a big hit that is gonna be played for for many years this is a much better model because I get paid based on how much people use the product not how much they thought they would use it day one or so forth so it was a complicated model to get across and but time helped with that right and now now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again then you know it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back up and so we're we're very really proud of having having been a part of that so there have been distinct problems I think when it comes to the to the labels we have taken the painful approach some of our competition at the time they kind of they kind of look that other companies instead if we just if we just ignore the rights and we get really big really fast we're gonna be too big for the the labels too kind of too big to fail they're not gonna kill us we didn't take that approach we went legal from day one and we we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated was very slow is very frustrating we were angry at seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it it was this this this game theory thing where over many rounds of playing the game this would be the right strategy and even though to clearly there's a lot of frustrations at times during negotiations there is this there is this weird trust where we have been honest and fair we never screw them the inner screwed us it's ten years but there's this trust in like they know that if music doesn't get really big if lots of people do not want to listen to music I want to pay for it Spotify has no business model so we actually are incredibly aligned right other companies not to be tense but other companies have other business models where even if they may know music from no money from music they still be profitable companies but fall if I want so and I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business-wise so there is this distrust that allows us to to do product development even if it's scary you know taking risks the free model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should get credit for now some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden but frankly a lot of the labels also took risk and so I think we built up that trust with a I think hurting what cats sounds a bit what's the word it sounds like I'm dismissive of the guests dismissive no everyday yeah you matter they're all beautiful and and very important exactly they've taken a lot of risks and certainly it's been frustrating about it yeah it's it's it's really like playing its its game theory if you play that if you play the game many times and then you can have this statistical outcome that you bet on and it feels very painful when you're in the middle of that thing I mean there's risk this trust there's relationships from just having read the biography of Steve Jobs similar kind of relationship were discussed in iTunes the idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels and exactly and there was no it was the same kind of thing it was trust it was game theory as is a lot of our relationships that had to be built and it's really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little bit because they could afford for that process to fail for Spotify it seems terrifying because you can't initially I think a lot of it comes out comes down to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in in negotiating which seems like an impossible this is a fun task because he was completely unknown and so forth but maybe that was also the reason that that it worked but I think yeah I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it you could straight go straight for this like Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or or you played many times you try to actually go for the top left the corporation cell is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have won this so a lot of people have tried to do a spot if I try to do and Spotify has come out well so the order is that there's no magical reason because I I don't believe in magic but I think there are there are reasons and I think some of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do the actual the actual Spotify model is very complicated they've looked at the premium model and said it seems like you can you can charge $9.99 for music and people are gonna pay but that's not what happened actually when we launched the original mobile product everyone said they would never pay what happened was they started on the on the free product and then their engagement grew so much that eventually they said maybe it is worth $9.99 right it's it's your propensity to pay grows with your engagement so we had this super complicated business model we operate two different business model advertising and premium at the same time and I think that is hard to replicate however I struggled to think of other companies that run large-scale advertising and subscription products at the same time so I think the business model is actually much more complicated than people think it is and and so some people went after just the premium part without the free part and ran into a wall where no one wanted to pay some people went after just music music should be free just ads which doesn't give you enough revenue and doesn't work for the music industry so I think that combination is kind of a pick from the outside so maybe I shouldn't say it here and reveal the secret but that that turns out to be hard to replicate then you with then you would think so there's a lot of brilliant business strategy here brilliance or luck probably more luck but it doesn't really matter it looks brilliant in retrospect let's call it brilliant yeah when the books are read no brilliant you've mentioned that your philosophy is to embrace change so how will the music streaming and music listening world change over the next 10 years 20 years you look out into the far future what do you think I think that music and for that matter audio podcasts audiobooks I think it's one of the few core human needs I think it there is no good reason to me why it shouldn't be at the scale of something like messaging or social networking I don't think it's a nice thing to listen to music or news or something so I think scale is obviously one of the things that I really hope for I think I hope that it's going to be billions of users I hope eventually everyone in the world gets access to all the world's music ever made so obviously I think it's going to be a much bigger business otherwise we we wouldn't be betting this big now if you if you look more at how it is consumed what I'm hoping is back to this analogy of the software tool chain where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to to text messaging text messaging was also based on standards in the in the area of mobile carriers you had the SMS the 140 character 2020 carrot SMS and it was great because everyone agreed on the standard so as a consumer you got a lot of distributions and interoperability but it was a very constrained format and and when the industry wanted to add pictures to that format to do the MMS I looked it up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000 this is like a 15 20 year product cycle to bring pictures into that now once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software stack with in something like snapchat or whatsapp like the first week they had a disappearing messages like then two weeks later they added stories like the pace of innovation when you're on one software stack and you can you can you can affect both creation and consumption I think is going to be rapid so with these streaming services we now for the first time in history have enough I hope people on one of these services actually whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple or or YouTube and hopefully enough creators that you can actually start working with a format again and and that excites me I think being able to change these constraints from a hundred years that could really that could really do something interesting I don't I really hope it's not just going to be their iteration on on the same thing for the next ten to twenty years as well yeah changing the creation of music equation of audio equation of podcast is a really fascinating possibility I myself don't understand what it is about podcast that's so intimate it just is I listen to a lot of podcasts I think it touches on a human and a deep human need for connection that people do feel like they're connected to when they listen I don't understand what the psychology that is but in this world that's becoming more and more disconnected it feels like this is fulfilling a certain kind of need and empowering the creator as opposed to just the listener it's really interesting so this is I'm really excited that you're working on it yeah I think one of the things that is inspiring for our teams to work on podcast is exactly that what do you think like I like I probably do that it's something biological about perceiving to be in the middle of the conversation that makes you listen in a different way it doesn't really matter people seem to perceive it differently and there was this narrative for a long time that you know if you look at video everything kind of in the foreground I got shorter and shorter and shorter because of financial pressure is a monetization and so forth an event at the end there zones like 20 seconds clipped people just screaming something and I'm really I feel really good about the fact that you you could have interpreted that as people have no attention span anymore they don't want to listen to things they're not interested in deeper stories like you know people are people are getting dumber but then podcast came along and it's almost like no no they need still existed once what but maybe maybe it was the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for two hours but if you can drive at the same time it seems like people really want to dig and they want to hear like the more complicated version so to me that is very inspiring that that podcast is actually long-form it gives me a lot of hope for for Humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper more complicated this is a I don't understand it it's fascinating so the majority for this podcast listen to the whole thing this whole conversation we've been talking for an hour and 45 minutes and somebody will I mean most people will be listening to these words I'm speaking right now they wouldn't have thought that 10 years ago with what the world seemed to go that's very positive I think that's really exciting and empowering the creator and there's really exciting last question you also have a passion for just mobile in general how do you see the smartphone world this the the digital space of of smartphones and just everything that's on the move whether it's Internet of Things and so on changing over the next 10 years and so on I think that one way to think about it is that computing might be moving out of these multi-purpose devices the computer we had in the phone into specific specific specific purpose devices and you know it will be ambient that you know at least in my home you just shout something at someone and there's always like one of these speakers close enough and so you start behaving differently it's as if you have the Internet ambient ambiently around you and you can ask it things so I think computing or kind of get more integrated and we won we won't necessarily think of that as as connected to a device and the same thing in the same way that we do today I don't know the path to that maybe we used to have these desktop computers and then we partially replace that with the with the laptops and left you know at home and at work and then we got these phones and we started leaving the laptop at home for a while and maybe the maybe for stretches of time you're gonna start using the watch and you can leave your your phone at home like for a run or something and you know we're on this progressive path where you I think what what is happening with the voice is that you haven't you have an interactive interaction paradigm that doesn't require as large physical devices so I definitely think there's a future where you can have your your airports and and your watch and you can do a lot of computing and I don't think it's gonna be this binary thing I think it's gonna be like many of us still have a laptop we just use it less and so you shift your your consumption over and I don't know about a or glasses and so forth um I'm excited about I spend a lot of time in that area but I still think it's quite far away they are VR oh yes VR is is happening and working I think the recent oculus quest is quite impressive I think AR is further away at least that type of AR I think but I do think your phone or water glasses understanding where you are and maybe what you're looking at and being able to give you all your cues about or you can say like what is this and it tells you what it is that I think might happen you you know you use your your watch to your glasses there's a as a mouse pointer on reality I think it might be a while before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong I think it might be a while before we walk around with these big like lab glasses then project things I agree with you there's a it's actually really difficult when you have to understand the physical world enough to project onto it well I lied about the last question because I just thought of audio and my favorite topic which is the movie her mm-hmm do you think well there's part of Spotify or not will have I don't know if you've seen the movie her absolutely and their audio is the primary form of interaction and the connection with another entity that you can actually have a relationship with actually fall in love with based on voice alone audio alone you how far do you think that's possible first of all based on audio alone to fall in love with somebody somebody or well yeah let's go with somebody just have a relationship based on audio alone and second question to that can we create an artificial intelligence system that allows one to fall in love with it and hurt him with you so there's my personal personal answer speaking for me as a person the answer is quite unequivocally yes on both I think what we just said about podcasts and the feeling of being in the middle of a conversation if you could have an assistant where and we just said that feels like a very personal settings so if you walk around with these headphones and this thing you're speaking with this thing all of the time that feels like it's in your brain I think it's it's gonna be much easier to fall in love with than something that would be on your screen I think that's entirely possible and then from that you can programs is better than me but from the concept of if it's going to be possible to build a machine that they can achieve that I think whether you whether you think of it as if you can fake it the philosophical zombie that it simulates it enough or it it somehow actually is I think there's it's only question if you ask me about time I'd had to be a financier but if you say a given some half infinite time absolutely I think it's just atoms and arrangement of information well I personally think that love is a lot simpler than people think so we started with true romance and ended in love I don't see a better place to end beautiful Gustav thanks so much for talking to thank you so much there was a lot of fun was fun you
