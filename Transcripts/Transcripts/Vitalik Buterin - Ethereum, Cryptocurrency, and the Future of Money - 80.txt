Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 vitalik butyrin co-creator of an author of the white paper that launched atheory 'm and ether which is a
 cryptocurrency that is currently the second largest digital currency afterbitcoin aetherium has a lot of
 interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchaintechnology and metallic is one of the
 most brilliant people innovating in the space todayunlike Satoshi Nakamoto the unknown
 person or group that created Bitcoin Vitalik is very well known and at ayoung age is thrust into the limelight
 as one of the main faces of the technology that may redefine the natureof money and all forms of digital
 transactions in the 21st century this is the artificial intelligence podcast ifyou enjoy it subscribe on youtube review

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :my conversation with vitalik uterine so


Speaker 1 :before we talk about the fundamental
 ideas behind a theory I'm a cryptocurrency perhaps it'd be nice toto talk about the the origin story of
 Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto you give a talk that startedwith sort of asking the question what
 did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent maybe you could say who is so Toshi

Speaker 0 :Nakamoto and what did he invent sure so
 Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came upwith Bitcoin so the reason why I say the
 name by which we know is that this is a yam anonymous fellow who has shownhimself to us only over the Internet
 just step by here first publishing the white paper for Bitcoin then releasingthe original source code for Bitcoin and
 then talking to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and and ifinteracting with that but helping the
 project along for a couple of years and then at some point in late 2010 early2011 he disappeared
 so Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in how it has this kind of mythical a kindof quasi godlike founder who
 just and if pops in he did the thing and if I disappeared and we were somehowjust never heard from him again so in


Speaker 1 :2008 was so the white paper was the
 first do you know the white paper was the first time the name was actually

Speaker 0 :appears that oshina come on leave so so


Speaker 1 :how is it possible that the creator of
 such a impactful project remains anonymous that's a tough question

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and there's no similarity to it in
 history of technology as far as I'm aware yeah

Speaker 0 :so one possibility is that it's healthy
 knee because healthy knee was and have also active in the Bitcoin community andas halfa Nia in those two beginning
 years and how is health any maybe I see you one of the people at the end ofearly cypherpunk community he was the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :computer scientists computer scientists
 cryptographers people interested in like technology Internet freedom like those

Speaker 1 :kinds of topics it was the correct that
 that rather he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest or the

Speaker 0 :first transaction of bitcoins yes the
 first transaction of ich werde was between sister was she had a health in

Speaker 1 :him do you think he knew who Satoshi was


Speaker 0 :if he wasn't Satoshi you probably know


Speaker 1 :how is it possible to work so closely
 with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamentalidentity it is this like a natural sort
 of characteristic of the Internet like if we were to think about it because youand I just met now there's a there's a
 depth of knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physicallike my vision system is able to
 recognize you I can also verify your identity ofuniqueness like yep this like it's very
 hard to fake you being you yes so the internet the Internet has afundamentally different quality to it
 which is just fascinating yeah I know

Speaker 0 :definitely interesting as I definitely
 just know a lot of people just by their internetand next to me when I think of them like
 I see their internet handles and one of them has enough profile picture as thiskind of face that's kind of not quite
 human with about your hand of psychedelic colors and at and when Ivisualize him I could just visualize


Speaker 1 :that that's not an actual face yeah you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :are the creator of the second
 well he's currently the second most popular kept across e aetherium so onthis topic if we just stick on Satoshi
 Nakamoto for a little bit longer you may be the most qualified person to speak tothe psychology of this anonymity that
 we're talking about mm-hmm like your identity is known like we I've justverified it but from your perspective
 what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaininganonymous like if I can psychoanalyze
 Satoshi Nakamoto is there something interesting there or just a peculiar

Speaker 0 :quirk of him it definitely helps create
 this kind of image of this mutual thing that doesn't belong to anyone and thenyou've created a project and because
 you're anonymous and because you also disappear or as unfortunately happenedto help any if that is him he ended up I
 think dying of abou Gehrig's disease and he's in a cryogenic freezer now but likeif you pop in and you'd and then you
 created an in you're gone and all that's remaining if that whole process is thething itself then like no one can go and
 try to and if interpret any of your other behavior and try to understandlike oh the like this person wrote this
 thing in some essay ID at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions aboutdemocracy and so because of that this
 project is like is a statement that's dragons you this specific thing insteadit creates this environment where the
 thing is what you make of it and it

Speaker 1 :doesn't have the yeah right the the
 burden of your other idea political thought and so on so so nowthen we're sitting with you do you feel
 the burden of being kind of the face of aetherium I mean there's a very largecommunity of developers but nevertheless


Speaker 0 :you know is there like a burden


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :associated with that there definitely is
 this is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for theetherium ecosystem to become more
 decentralized in many ways the just encouraging a lot of kind of core ceriumwork to happen outside of the etherium
 foundation and if expanding the number of people that are making differentkinds of decisions having multiple
 software bill notations instead of one and all of these things like there's alot of things that I've tried to do it
 too and we've removed myself as a single point of failure because that issomething that a lot of people criticize
 me for so if you look at like the most

Speaker 1 :fundamentally successful open source
 projects okay it seems that it's like a sad reality when I think about it is itseems to be that one person is a crucial
 contributor often if you look a lioness from from for Linux for the kernel that

Speaker 0 :is possible and I'm definitely not
 planning to disappear

Speaker 1 :that's an interesting tension that
 projects like this kind of desire a single entity and yet they'refundamentally distributed I don't know
 if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure andthinking about the future of
 cryptocurrency does there need to be a

Speaker 0 :leader
 there's different kinds of leaders you know there's there's dictators whocontrol all the money there's people who
 control organizations there's a kind of high priests that just have themselveshave their twitter followers what kind


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :of leader are you would you say actually
 a bit more in the hyper in the high priests direction than beforeyeah like I definitely actually don't do
 all that much of kind of going around and make ordering aetherium foundationpeople to do things because I think
 those things are important if there's something that I do think it's importantI use I do just do usually I kind of say
 it publicly or just gonna say it to people and quite often projects just

Speaker 1 :gonna start doing it so let's ask the -
 Safa cool question just about money yeah what at the highest level is money

Speaker 0 :what is money it's a kind of game and
 it's a game where we have points and like if you have points there's this onemove where you can reduce your points by
 a number and increase someone else's voice by the same number and these it's

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a fair game hopefully well it's one kind
 of fair game like for example you know you can have other kinds of fair gameslike you're gonna have a game where if I
 give someone a points and you give someone a points and instead of thatperson getting two points that person
 gets four points and that's also fair but no money is easy to kind of set upfor and it serves a lot of useful
 functions and so it kind of just survives in society as a meme forthousands of years it's useful for the


Speaker 1 :storage of wealth useful for the


Speaker 0 :exchange of value and it's also useful
 for words and nominating future payments a unit of account

Speaker 1 :a unit of account so what if you look at
 the history of money in human civilization what just uh if you're astudent of history like how has its role
 or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view even if we justlook at the 20th century before and then
 leading up to cryptocurrencies that's something

Speaker 0 :think about yeah and I think like the
 big thing in the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot more intermediationyes thank you I mean the first part is
 and if the move from Bing yeah adding more of different kindsof banking and then we saw the move from
 and if dollar is being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's onlyredeemable by certain people $2 not
 being backed by anything soo and it's just this new system where you have abunch of free floating currencies and
 then people like I'm getting and if bank accounts and then those things becomingelectronic people getting accountable
 payment processors that have account bank accounts so so what do you make of

Speaker 1 :that
 that's a fascinating so philosophical idea that money might not be backed byanything what is that like the
 fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something

Speaker 0 :physical it definitely is what do you


Speaker 1 :make of that like how how is that
 possible is that stable if you look at the future of human civilization is itpossible to have money at the large
 scale it such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operatesuccessfully without money being backed


Speaker 0 :by anything physical feel like the
 interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of theimportant valuable things are not backed
 by anything like if you look at like tech companies for example likesomething like Twitter and like you
 could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to or they couldhave kind of come together they would
 quit and you know start working on Twitter 2.0 and then the yeah of how youwill and just kind of build the exact
 the the exact same product source possibly build a better product and thenjust and if continue on from there and
 the original the original Twitter would've just not have people leftanymore right like that
 there is theoretically kind of code and like IP that's owned by the company butin reality
 good programmers could probably read up rewrite all that stuff in three monthsso the like the reason why the thing has
 value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems right likethis employees in reality aren't going
 to switch all at once and also the users aren't all going to switch at oncebecause it's just difficult for them to
 switch at once and so there's these and of metastable and of equilibria ininteractions between thousands of
 millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if youtry to kind of assume that everyone's a
 perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow they don't seemto exist at all this that stickiness do


Speaker 1 :you have a sense a grasp of the sort of
 the fun fundamental dynamic like the physics of that stickiness it seems towork but and I think some of the
 cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it

Speaker 0 :working yeah it's you know it's the sort
 of thing that's definitely been have economically modeled a lot I wanna be akind of analogy of something as similar
 that you often see in textbooks as like what is say yeah government like if forexactly
 any person if people in a country just like tomorrow suddenly had had the ideathat like the laws that are currently
 the laws in the government that currently is the government are justpeople and some of us and some other
 thing it is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then thatwould kind of become the new reality and
 then the question is well what happens if and if between 0 and 80 people are itwere an 80% if people start believing
 that like what is the thing you also you see instead if there is one of thesekind of switches happening is kind of
 revolution then if you're the first person to join then like you probablyprobably don't have the incentive to do
 that but then if you're the 55th percentile person to join and thensuddenly becomes quite safe too and so
 this definitely is the sort of thing that you can and if try to analyze itunderstand mathematically but one of the
 and if results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely canbe chaotic sometimes yeah but still like


Speaker 1 :to me the idea that the network effects
 that the fact that human beings at a scale like millions billions ensure eventhe idea of currency big yeah all agree
 that's just I know I can almost model it I'm a skeptic on the economic it's likesomebody my favorite sort of field maybe
 recreationally psychology is trying to take human behavior and I thinksometimes people just kind of pretend
 that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it's such amessy space that all the models that
 psychology or economics those different perspectives on human behavior you canhave or are difficult it's difficult to
 know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting tothe core of understanding human behavior
 but on that idea what do you think is the role of money in human motivation sodo you think money from an economics
 perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like human

Speaker 0 :desires money is definitely very far
 from the only motivator it is a big motivator and that's one of the closestthings you have to a universal motivator
 think because ultimately in the almost any person in the world if you ask themto do something they'll be more inclined
 to do it if you also offer some offer the money right and that's big there'sdefinitely many cases where people will
 do things other than things that maximize how much money they have andthat happens all the time but like
 though a lot of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and ifwho that person is and if where their
 situation is the relationship between the motive in the action and these otherthings what do you think is in the


Speaker 1 :interplay of the other motivator from
 like Nietzsche perspectives power do you think money equals power do you thinkthose are conflicting ideas do you think
 that's the one of the ideas that decentralized currency decentralizedapplications are looking at is who holds


Speaker 0 :the power yeah money is definitely a
 kind of power and there's definitely people who want money because it givesthem power and then even if my money
 doesn't seem to and have explicitly be about money a lot of things that peoplespend money on are ultimately about a
 social status of some kind I definitely view those two things as aninterplaying and then there's also money
 as just a way of like measuring how successful you are I guess a scoreboardright so this kind of gets back to the
 game like if you have four billion dollars then the main benefit you getfrom going out or one of the big
 benefits you get from going up to six million dollars is that now instead ofbeing below the guy who has five year
 above the guy who has five so you think

Speaker 1 :money could be kind of in a game of life
 it's also a measure of self-worth it's

Speaker 0 :like how we it's definitely how I have a
 lot of people perceive it define

Speaker 1 :ourselves you know hierarchy of yeah I'm


Speaker 0 :not yeah not saying it's kind of a
 healthy thing that people define yourself worthless money because it'sdefinitely and of far from a perfect
 indicator of how much you like you value you provide the Society or anything likethis but I definitely think that they as
 a matter of kind of current practice a bunch of people do feel that way so what

Speaker 1 :does utopia from an economic perspective


Speaker 0 :look like to you what is the perfect


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :world look like
 I guess The Economist's utopia would be one where kind of everything is anincentive aligns in the same in the
 sense that there aren't enough conflicts between what satisfies your goals andkind of what is good for and if everyone
 in the world in the world as a whole

Speaker 1 :what do you think that would look like
 this does that mean they're still poor peopleand rich people they're still income
 inequality do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong do you think sort ofideas of Objectivism
 like where the market rules is strong like what is there is the differenteconomic philosophies that just seem to
 be reflective what utopia would be no I

Speaker 0 :definitely think that existing economic
 philosophy is do end up kind of systematically deviating from the utopiain a lot of ways yeah like one of the
 big things I talk about for example is public goods right and public goods areespecially important on the Internet
 right yes like the idea is what kind of money as this game where you know I wasa few coin a few coins and you gain the
 same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where I losesome money you gain some money you lose
 a sandwich and I gain a sandwich and this and if model works really well whenthe thing that were using money to
 incentivize this kind of private goods right things that you provide to oneperson where the benefit comes to one
 person but the like on the internet especially but also many many contextsand if off the internet there's actions
 that and if individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit goingto one person the benefit just goes to
 many people at the same time and you can't control where the benefit goes toright so for example this podcast I know
 we publish it and when it's published you don't have any fine-grained controlover like oh these 38,000 people can
 watch it and then like these other 29,000 people can't it's like once thenumber goes high enough then you know
 people just like copy it and then when I write articles on a blog then they'rejust like free for everyone and that
 stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying so and aside from thatthings like you know scientific research
 for example and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate changemitigation would be a big one
 so there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individualactions with have concentrated cost and
 distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job ofencouraging these things and one of the
 kind of other things even tangentially connected to crypto but kind oftheoretically outside of it that I work
 on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding and the way to thinkabout it is I and I've imagined a point
 system where if like if one person gives coin gives points to one other personthen it works the same way as money but
 if multiple people and give coins to one person and they do so anonymously soit's kind if not in consideration for a
 specific service to that person themselves and thenthe number of Quinns are received by
 that person and of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that havegiven by those different people so the
 actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gavethen you add all the square roots so
 then you're going to square the sums because yeah and then you give that andthe idea here would basically be that if
 let's say for example you just started going off and kind of planting a lot oftrees and there's a bunch of people that
 are really happy that you're planting trees so that so they go and all kind ofthrow a coin your way then the like
 there is like basically the fact that kind of you get more than the sum youget this kind of square of some of these
 of a square root some of these tiny amounts as that this actually and ifcompensates for the tragedy of the
 Commons rightness there is even this kind of mathematical proof that it'ssort of optimally compensates for it


Speaker 1 :what is the tragedy of the Commons this


Speaker 0 :is just this idea that if there is this
 situation where there's some public good that lots of people benefit from then noindividual person wants to contribute to
 it because if they contribute to only get a small part of the benefit fromtheir contribution but they pay the full
 cost of their contribution in which

Speaker 1 :context is this sorry what is the term


Speaker 0 :quadratic quadratic funding like what's


Speaker 1 :in which context is this mechanism
 useful so obviously you said to combat the tragedy of the Commons but you knowin which context do you see it as useful


Speaker 0 :in practice yes theoretically public
 goods in general right so like like

Speaker 1 :services like what do we what are we


Speaker 0 :talking about what's the public within
 the etherium ecosystem for example like we've actually tried using thismechanism I wrote a couple of articles
 about the Senate on Vitalik CA where it goes through some of the most recentrounds and it's been really interesting
 some of the top ones that people supported there were things like you canjust unwind user interfaces that make it
 easier for people to interact with etherium there was documentation thereare podcasts there were you know
 software and of clients like kind of implementations of the etherium protocolof privacy tools just like lots of
 things that are gonna be useful to lots

Speaker 1 :of people wouldn't a lot of people are
 contributing for like funding a particular take care entity yeah andit's really actually interesting is
 there something special about the quadratic the the the summing of thesquare roots yeah so another way to


Speaker 0 :think about it is like imagine if n
 people each give a dollar then the person gets N squared right and and soeach individual person's contribution
 gets multiplied by n because you have n people and so that kind of perfectlycompensates for the kind that kind of
 end to one tragedy over the comments I

Speaker 1 :just wonder if the squared part is yeah


Speaker 0 :fundamental though it is an Ida
 recommend you go to Vitalik CA I have this article calledquadratic payments of primer and highly
 recommended it's kind of at least my attempt so far and if exploiting theintuition behind this intuition so if we


Speaker 1 :could can we go to the
 the very basic what is the blockchain or perhaps we might even start at the theByzantine generals problem and
 presenting fault tolerance in general that I big coin was taking steps toproviding a solution for so the


Speaker 0 :Byzantine generals problem it's this
 paper that Leslie Lamport published in 1982 where she has thought experimentswhere if you have two generals that are
 camped out on opposite sides of a city and they're planning when to attack thecity then the question is and if how
 could those generals coordinate with each other and they could sendmessengers between each other but those
 messengers and if could get sniped by the enemy on the row road some of thosemessages could end up being traitors and
 if things could end up happening and with just twomess generals it turns out that there's
 and if no solution and a finite number of rounds that guarantee is dead theywill be able to end of coordinate on the
 same answer but then in the case where you have more than two generals thatthen Leslie analyzes cases like are the
 mess and message is kind of just oral messages are the messages kind of signedmessages so I can give you a man
 assigned messages and you can pass along that signed message and the third partycould still verify that I originally
 made that message and depending on those different cases there's kind ofdifferent bounds on like given how many
 generals and how many traders among those generals so I move whether likeunder what conditions you actually can't
 agree once I launch an attack so it's actually a big misconception that thethe Byzantine generals problem was
 unsolved so let's go import solve that the thing that was unsolved though isthat all of these solutions assume that
 you've already agreed on and I'm affixed a list of who the generals are and thesegenerals have to be a kind of semi
 trusted to some extent they can't just be anonymous bebecause if they're anonymous stand like
 the enemy could just be 99% of the generals uh so I'm in the 1980s and the1990s head of the general use case for
 distributed system stuff was more and if enterprise-e stuff where you could andhave assumed that no you know who the
 nodes are that are running the sign of computer networks so if he wants to havesome movement of decentralized computer
 network that pretends to be a single computer and that you can kind of do ado and of operations on then it's made
 out of these and a fifty in specific computers and we know and if who andwhere they are and so we have a good
 reason to believe that say at least eleven of that would be fine and it

Speaker 1 :could also be within a single system yes
 exactly almost a network of devices sensors youknow on like in air airplanes and I
 think like flight systems generally use

Speaker 0 :these kinds of ideas yep yep so that's
 the eighties that's the eighties and nineties now the cypherpunks had adifferent use case in mind which was
 that they wanted to create a yeah for a decentralized global permission wascurrency and the problem here is that
 they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind ofprivilege the list of people and so now
 the question is well how do you use these techniques to create consensuswhen you have no way of kind of
 measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether ornot some 99% of participants aren't
 actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that's it was she hadthis is and if going back to the that
 presentation I made a Def Con a few months ago where I said that the thingsthat o she invented was crypto economics
 is this a really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of alladmit identity how many identities you
 can get and the if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currencythat the only way to do this is with
 proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is just youpublish a solution to a hard
 mathematical puzzle that takes some and if clearly calculable amount ofcomputational power to solve you get an
 identity and then you solve a five of those puzzles you get five identitiesand then these are the identities that
 we run the kids not this algorithm

Speaker 1 :between so the proof-of-work mechanism
 you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in in thewhite paper that defines bitcoin what's
 the idea of consensus that we wish to reach what wise consensus important here

Speaker 0 :what is consensus so the goal here in
 just simple technical terms yes to kind of wire together a set of a large numberof computers in such a way that they
 kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that singlede pute er keeps working even if a large
 portion of the kind of constituents the computers that make it up break it kindof break in arbitrary ways like they
 could shut off they could try to actively break a system they could dolots of mean things so the reason why
 the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run oneparticular program on this virtual
 computer and the one particular program that they wanted to run is just acurrency system right it's a system that
 just processes a series of transactions and for every transaction it verifiesthat the sender has enough coins to pay
 for the transaction it verifies that the digital signature is correct and if thechecks pass then it subtracts the coins
 from one accounts and adds the coins to the other account roughly so first of

Speaker 1 :all the the proof of work idea is kind
 of I mean at least to me seems pretty fascinating it is I mean that's a it'skind of a revolutionary idea is it is it
 obvious to come up with that you can use you can exchange basically computationalresources for for identity it's it


Speaker 0 :actually has a pretty long history it
 was first proposed in a paper by a Cynthia to workin a or in 1994 I believe and the
 original use case was a combating email spam so the idea is that if you send anemail you have to send it with a
 proof-of-work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emailsto your friends but it makes it really
 expensive to send spam to a million

Speaker 1 :people yeah that's a simple brilliant
 idea so maybe also taking a step back so what is the role of blockchain in thiswhat is blockchain sure so the


Speaker 0 :blockchain I mean my way of thinking
 about it is that it is this and if system where you have this kindof one virtual computer created by this
 a bunch of these of nodes in the network and the reason why the term blockchainis used is because the data structure
 that these systems use at least so far is one where they even if differentnodes in the network periodically
 published blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with apointer like a hash of a previous block
 that it builds on top of and so you have a series of blocks that that no one's inthe network create for each block points
 to the previous block and so you have

Speaker 1 :this chain of them is a fault tolerance
 mechanism built into the idea of blockchain there's a lot ofpossibilities I've got a ways to make
 sure there's no funny stuff going on

Speaker 0 :there are indeed a lot of possibilities
 so in Egan and just simple architecture as I just described is the way the faulttolerance happens it's like this right
 so you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily and if occasionallycreating blocks building on top of each
 other's blocks and let's say you have kind of one block we'll call it kind ofblock one yeah and then someone else
 builds another block honestly we'll call it block two then we have an attackerand what the attacker tries to do is the
 attacker tries to revert block two and the way the revert block two is insteadof doing the thing they're supposed to
 do which is build a block on top of block two they're gonna build anotherblock on top of block one so you have
 block one which has two children block two in thewalk to prime now this light sometimes
 even happened by random chance if you know two nodes in the networkjust happened to create blocks at the
 same time and then over here about each other's things before they create theirown but this also could happen because
 of an attack now if this happens you have an attack then we know in theBitcoin system the nodes follow the
 longest chain so if this attack had happened and if when the original chainhad more than two blocks on its know if
 it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks then everyonewould just taken one just ignore it and
 everyone would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we havewalked two and we have walked two prime
 and snow this you were kind of even and then whatever block the next block iscreated on top of so say block three is
 now created on top of block two prime then everyone says agrees that blockthree is than you had and block two
 prime is just kind of forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully buildson top of block 3 anything continues so


Speaker 1 :how difficult is it to mess with the
 system I know so how like if we look at the general problem like how many whatfraction of people who participate in
 the system have to be bad players in

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :order to mess with actually like what's
 your is there is there a good number

Speaker 0 :areas well depending on kind of what
 your model of the participants is and like what kind of attack we're talkingabout it's anywhere between twenty three
 point two and fifty percent of what of

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :all of the computing power in the


Speaker 1 :network sorry so twenty two and twenty


Speaker 0 :or three point between twenty three


Speaker 1 :point zero and 50% and 50% are can be


Speaker 0 :compromised so like once you're once
 your purse your portion of the total computing power the network goes abovethe twenty three point two level then
 there's and if things that you could mean things that you can potentially doand as your percentage of the network
 kind of keeps going up then the your abilities does you mean things kind ofgoes higher and then if you have
 about 50% then you can just break

Speaker 1 :everything so how hard is it to achieve
 that level like it seems that so far historically speaking it's beenexceptionally difficult so this is a


Speaker 0 :challenging question so the economic
 cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high I think it'ssomewhere in the low billions of dollars


Speaker 1 :and when you say that stuff you mean


Speaker 0 :computational resources yeah so
 specifically specialized hardware and of Asics that people use to solve thesepuzzles to do the mining small tangent


Speaker 1 :so obviously I work a lot in deep
 learning with GPUs and Asics for that application and I tangentially kind ofhere that's so many of these you know
 sometimes NVIDIA GPUs are sold out

Speaker 0 :uh-huh because because of this other


Speaker 1 :application that would do work if you
 can come out I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space whatkind of Asics what kind of hardware is
 generally used these days for the to do the actual computation for theproof-of-work


Speaker 0 :sure so in the case in Bitcoin and
 etherium are a bit different so in the case of Bitcoin there is an algorithmcalled sha-256 it's just a hash function
 and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number isbelow some threshold and so because the
 hashes are designed to be random you just have to keep on trying differentnumbers until one works and the Asics
 are just like specialized store gets to contain and if circuits for evaluatingthis hash over and over again and you
 have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on topof each other inside of a box and you
 just keep on running the box 24/7 and

Speaker 1 :the issues there's literally specialized
 hardware design for this yes oh this is we live in an amazing world anothertangent and I'll come back to the basics
 but this quantum computing throw a wrench into any of this very good

Speaker 0 :question
 so what quantum computers have two main and a families of algorithms that arerelevance to cryptography one is a
 Shor's algorithm ensures algorithm is one of kimbleyhe breaks the hardness of some specific
 kinds of mathematical problems so the one that you've probably heard of is itmakes it very easy to factor numbers so
 it figure out kind of what prime factors are they're kind of that you need tomultiply together to get some number
 even if that number is extremely big Shor's algorithm can also be used tobreak and look to curve cryptography it
 can break like any kind of hit an order group so it breaks a lot of kind ofcryptographic nice things that we're
 used to but the good news is that for every and of major use of things thatShor's algorithm breaks we already know
 of quantum proof alternatives now these we don't use these quantum proofalternatives yet because in many cases
 they're faster ten times what sufficient but and the crypto industry in generalkind of knows that this is coming
 eventually and it's kind of ready to take the hit and switch to that stuffwhen we when we have to the second
 algorithm that is the relevant to cryptography is Grover's algorithm andin Grover's algorithm might even be a
 more familiar to AI people that's basically usually described as solvingsearch problems them but the idea here
 is that if you have a problem over the form find a number that satisfies someproperty then if with a classical
 computer you needs to try and have n times before before you find a numberthen with a quantum computer you only
 need to do square root of n computations and the Grover's could potentially beused for mining but there's two
 possibilities here one is that Grover's could be used formining and whoever creates the first
 working quantum computer that could do Grover's will just mind way faster thaneveryone else and we'll see another
 round of what we saw when a six came out which is that kind of the new hard werejust kind of dominated the old stuff and
 then eventually it switched to a new

Speaker 1 :equilibrium but by the way way faster
 not exponentially faster quadratic we

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :found radically faster which is not sort
 of uh it's not game-changing I would say it'slike a sex like you said it would be


Speaker 0 :exactly yes so it would not necessarily
 break proof-of-work as of this right yeah yeah the other kind of possibleworld right is that quads are computers
 have a lot of overhead there's a lot of Anacapa like city involved inmaintaining quantum states and there's
 also as we've been realizing recently meeting quantum computers were actuallywork requires that have quantum error
 correction which requires kind of a thousand real qubits per logical qubitand so there's the very real possibility
 that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than thespeed-up you get with Grover's which
 would be kind of sad but which would also mean that given proof of work we'lljust keep working fine so the


Speaker 1 :beautifully put soso proof of work is
 the core idea of Bitcoin is there are other core ideas before we kind of takea step towards the origin story and
 ideas of aetherium is there other stuff that will key to the white paper of

Speaker 0 :Bitcoin there is proof of work and then
 there's just the cryptography it just kind of public keys and signatures thatare used to verify transactions those
 two are the big things so then what is

Speaker 1 :the origin story maybe the human side
 but also the technical side of aetherium

Speaker 0 :sure
 so I joined the Bitcoin community in 2011 you know they started by justwriting I first wrote for the sort of
 online thing called Bitcoin weekly then I started writing for Bitcoin magazineum you know sorry to interrupt you have


Speaker 1 :this funny kind of story true or not is
 that you were disillusioned by the downsides of centralized control fromyour experience with Wow world of
 warcraft is this true or you're just

Speaker 0 :being woody I mean the event is true the
 fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is witty maybe just a

Speaker 1 :small tangent have you always had a
 skepticism of centralized control is

Speaker 0 :that sloppy Korea has that feeling


Speaker 1 :evolved over time or is that just always
 been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future ofhuman society it's definitely been


Speaker 0 :something that felt very attractive to
 me ever since I could afford that such a thing is possible yeah they're so great

Speaker 1 :so you're you joined the Bitcoin
 community in 2011 you say you began writing so what what's next

Speaker 0 :started writing moved from high school
 to university a half way in between that spent a year in university then at theend of that year I had dropped out to do
 Bitcoin things full-time and this was a combination of continuing the rightBitcoin magazine but also increasingly
 work on software projects and I traveled around the world for about six monthsand just going to different Bitcoin
 communities like I went to first in New Hampshire then Spain other Europeanplaces
 I'm Israel then San Francisco and along the way and have met a lot of otherpeople that are working on different
 Bitcoin projects and when I was in Israel there were some kind of verysmart teams there that were working on
 ideas that people were starting to kind of called Bitcoin 2.0 so one of theseworse colored coins which is basically
 saying that hey let's not just use the blockchain for Bitcoin but let's alsokind of issue other kinds of assets on
 it and then there is a protocol called master coin that supported issuingassets but also supported many other
 things like financial contracts like domain name registration and a lot ofdifferent things together and I spent
 some time working with these teams and I quickly kind of realized that thismaster coin protocol could be improved
 by kind of generalizing it more right so the best the analogy I use is that themaster coin protocol was like the Swiss
 Army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 differentapplications but what I realized is that
 you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general-purpose soone of them was that you could replace
 like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with ageneric transaction type for a financial
 contract so just what you specify mathematical formula for kind ofgurgi how much money each side gets by


Speaker 1 :the way it's a small pause what's you
 say financial contract just the terminology what is the contractwhat's a financial contract so the a


Speaker 0 :this is just generally an agreement
 where I know if either one or two parties kind of put collateral or kindof in and then they depending on and if
 certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this couldinvolve different the actions of the two
 parties could involve other things but they you kind of get rid of differentamounts of and of assets out that it'll
 just depend on things that happened so a

Speaker 1 :contract is really a financial contract
 as at the core it's the it's the core interactive element of a financial

Speaker 0 :system yeah there's there's many
 different kinds of financial contracts like there's things like options whereyou kind of give someone the right to
 buy a thing that you have for some specific price for some period of timethere's contracts for difference where
 you basically are kind of making a bet that says like for every dollar thisthing goes up I'll give you $7 or for
 every dollar the thing goes down you give me $7 or something like that you

Speaker 1 :know but the main idea that these
 contracts have to be enforced and

Speaker 0 :trusted then yes exactly you have to


Speaker 1 :trust that they will work out in a
 system where nobody can be trusted yes

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :this is such a beautiful complicated
 system okay so so you're seeking to kind of generalize this basic framework ofcontracts hmm so what is that entail so
 what what technically are the steps to creating aetherium sure so I guess just

Speaker 0 :they're going to continue a bit with
 this master coin story term so started by and of giving ideas for how togeneralize the thing and eventually this
 turned into a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says hey howabout you scrap all your future is and
 instead you just put in this programming language and I gave this idea to themand their response was something like
 hey this is great but this seems complicated and this seems likesomething that's we're not gonna be able
 to put onto a road map for a while and my response to this was like wait doyou not realize how revolutionary this
 is well just go do it myself and then I was the name of the programming approach

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :I just called it ultimate scripting
 great so then I kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and thenthe idea for aetherium itself started to
 form and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit ofthe thing is what we call contracts as
 these and if accounts that can hold assets and like they have their owninternal memory but that are controlled
 by a piece of code and so if I send some ether to a contract the only thing thatcan determine where that and if either
 the currency inside etherium item goes after that is the code of that contractitself and so basically you're kind of
 sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm forcreating these sort of agreement self
 executing agreements self executing as

Speaker 1 :so cool that code is sort of part of
 this contract so that that's what's meant by smart contracts yeah so howhard was it to build this kind of thing


Speaker 0 :harder than expected I mean originally I
 actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually workon for a couple of months published and
 then go back to university then I released it and a bunch of people or Ireleased a white paper white paper that
 paper a whole bunch of people came in offering how about huge number of peopleand have expressed interest and this was
 something I was totally not expecting and then I kind of realized that thiswould be something that's kind of much
 bigger than I had ever thought that it would be and then we started on thiskind of much longer development slog of
 making something that lives up to this sort of much higher level ofexpectations what if this some of those


Speaker 1 :is it fundamentally software engineering
 challenges your whether social okay so there's a social so so what are thebiggest interesting challenges that
 you've learned about human civilization and engine software engineering through

Speaker 0 :this process so I guess one of the
 challenges for me is that like I'm one of the I know apparently unusual geekscourse and have never treated with
 anything but kindness in school yes and so when I got into crypto I kind ofexpected everyone would just kind of be
 the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way but the and if thealgorithm that I used for finding
 co-founders for this thing was not very good it was literally what computerscientists called the greedy algorithm
 it's said of the first 15 people who replied back offering to help and if Iwere the co-founders do you mean like


Speaker 1 :literally the people that four will form
 the founders cofounders of the community the algorithm I like how you call it the

Speaker 0 :algorithm yeah and so what happened was
 that these but especially as the project got really big like there started to bea lot of this kind of infighting and
 there are a lot of like I wanted the thing to be a non-profit and some ofthem wanted to be a for-profit and then
 there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with eachother there were people that were kind
 of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of different waysand this just about six months later
 went to this big governance crisis and then we got a reshuffled leadership abit and then the project kept on going
 then nine months later there was another governance crisis and then there was athird governance crisis and so is there


Speaker 1 :a way to looking at the human side of
 things is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world itseems that there is from my perspective
 there's a lot of different characters and personalities and egos and like yousaid I don't know if you know I also
 like to think that most of the world mostly people in the world arewell-intentioned but the way those
 intentions are realised may perhaps come off as you know as negative like what isthere is there a hopeful message here
 about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that where everyone

Speaker 0 :gets along and after about four rounds
 of reshuffle like I think we've actually come up with something that seems to bepretty stable and happy and I think I
 mean I definitely do think that you know most people are well-intentioned I justthink that like one of the reasons why I
 like decentralization is just because there's like this thing about powerwhere power attracts people with egos
 and so that just allows a very small percentage of people to just ruin so

Speaker 1 :many things you think he goes uh you
 think ego has a use like is he go always

Speaker 0 :bad it seems like sometimes does but
 Scindia theory research team I feel like we've found also kind of a lot a lot ofvery good people that are just gonna
 primarily you're just interested in things for the technology and the thingsays seem to just generally be going
 quite well yeah when you're when the

Speaker 1 :focus and the passion is an attack so on
 the so that's the human side of things but and the technology side like whathave you learned what would have been
 the biggest challenges of bringing aetherium to life on the technology side

Speaker 0 :so I think first of all just you know
 there's like the first law of software development which is that when someonegives you a timetable of which the unit
 of time to the next largest unit of time and add one he's like we basically fellvictim to that and so instead of taking
 this at like three months it ended up taking like 20 months to watch the thingthat was just I think under estimating
 the sheer technical complexity over the thingthere were research challenges like so
 for example one of the things that we've been sayingfrom the start that we would do one is a
 switch from a proof of work to a proof of stake more proof of stake is thisalternative consensus mechanism where
 instead of there having to waste a lot of a computing power on solving thesemathematical Possible's that don't mean
 anything you kind of proved that you have access to coins inside of thesystem and this gives you some level of
 participation in the consensus can you

Speaker 1 :maybe elaborate on that a little bit I
 understand the idea of proof of work I know that a lot of people say that theidea of proof of stake is really
 appealing can maybe linger on a longer

Speaker 0 :explain what it is sure so basically the
 idea is like if I kind of a walk up a hundred coins then I turned that into akind of court virtual Minor and the
 system itself I kind of automatically in a random way assigns that in a virtualminor is a right to create blocks at
 particular intervals and then if someone else has 200 coins and then a walk onthe walk there's 200 coins then they get
 a kind of twice as big a virtual minor they'll be able to create blocks twiceas often good so it tries to do similar
 things to proof of work except instead of the thing and if very limiting yourparticipation being your ability to
 crank out its solutions to and if hash challenges the thing that real love isyour participation is kind of how much
 coins you're walking into this mechanism

Speaker 1 :okay so interesting so that that limit
 of participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute mmm-hmmdoes that mean that the richer you are
 so rich people are more like their

Speaker 0 :identities more right and this stable
 yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the

Speaker 1 :right terminology is right and this is


Speaker 0 :definitely a copied critique I think my
 usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind ofthing exactly yeah I didn't mean it


Speaker 1 :investing there's a criticism I think
 you're exactly right that's equivalent the proof of work is the samekind of thing but before work you have
 to also use physical resources yes and

Speaker 0 :burn computers and burn trees and all of


Speaker 1 :that stuff is there a way to mess with
 the system of the proof of proof of

Speaker 0 :stake there is but you will once again
 need to have a very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the systemto do anything bad


Speaker 1 :got it yeah and just to that maybe take
 a small change and one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that itgets for the proof of work mechanism you
 have to use so much energy in the world yes is one of the motivations of proofof stake is to move away from this
 definitely like what's your sense of it maybe I'm just under informed is therelike legitimately environmental impact


Speaker 0 :from this yeah so the latest thing was
 that Bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of Austria or something likethat yeah and then etherium is like
 right now me only like half an order of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin I've

Speaker 1 :heard you talking about a theorem 2.0 so
 what's the what's the dream of a theorem 2.0 what's the the status of proof ofstake is the mechanism that a theory
 moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensussure that within a cup of currency so


Speaker 0 :theorem 2.0 is a collection of major
 upgrades that we've wanted to do to aetherium for quite some time the twobig ones one is upper of steak and the
 other is so we call sharding sharding solves another problem with block chainswhich is a scalability and what sharding
 does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network havingto personally download and verify every
 transaction everybody else pins in the network only downloads and verifies asmall portion of transactions eelain's
 you kind of randomly distribute who gets how much work and because the issue ofhow the distribution is random it still
 has the property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corruptwhat's going on inside of any shard but
 the system is still in a very redundant and very secure

Speaker 1 :how hard is that to implement and how
 hard is proof of stake to implement like on a technical level yes after level

Speaker 0 :proof of stake in charting are both
 challenging might say charting is a bit more challenging the reason is thatproof of stake is can have just I
 changed the causa consensus or works sharding does both that but it's also achange to the networking layer the
 reason is that charting is kind of pointless if at the networking layer youstill do what you do today which is you
 kind of gossip everything which means that if someone publishes somethingevery other node and the client Sears it
 a like from on the networking layer and so instead we have to have and if subnetworks and the ability to quickly
 switch between sub networks and other sub networks talk to each other and thisis all doable but it's say yeah more
 complex architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that it has not yetbeen done in cryptocurrencies so most


Speaker 1 :most of the networking layer in
 cryptocurrency is you're shouting like broadcast messages and this is more likead hoc networks like yeah you're


Speaker 0 :shouting within smaller groups small


Speaker 1 :group but do you have like a bunch of
 sub note like exactly you have to switch

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :between ah man I'd love to see that
 there's a beautiful idea so from a graph theoretic perspective but just thesoftware that who's responsible is a
 theorem project like the people involved would they be implementing like what'sthe actual you know this is like legit
 software engineering who like how does that work how do people collaboratebuild that kind of project is this like
 almost like is there a software engineering lead is there it's like isit legit almost like large-scale
 open-source projects

Speaker 0 :yeah so we have someone named Danny Ryan
 on our team has just been brilliant and great all around and he is a kind of defacto kind of development coordinator I
 guess it's like you have to invent job titles for this stuff as the reason isthat look we also have this unique kind
 of organizational structure where they theorem foundation itself and of doesresearch in-house but then the actual
 implementation is by independent teams that are separatecompanies and they're located all around
 the world and fun places like Australia and and so no you can kind of just needa bunch of and have almost non-stop cat
 herding to just keep getting these people to have talked to each other andnever kind of implement this back make
 sure that everyone agrees on mind of what what's going on and kind of how tointerpret different things so how far


Speaker 1 :into the future are we from these two
 mechanisms and etherium 2.0 like what's what's your sense of the timelinekeeping in mind the previous comment you
 made about the sort of general curse of

Speaker 0 :software projects so if the REM 2.0 is
 split into three phases so face gyro just creates a proof stake network andit's actually separate from and of proof
 of the proof of work network at the beginning just and if give it time togrow and improve itself do people get to


Speaker 1 :choose sorry to interrupt if people get
 to choose I guess yes you can think yes

Speaker 0 :I choose to move over if they want to
 then phase one adds sharding but it only adds sharding of and of data storage andnot charting of computation and then
 after that there is and if the merger phase which is where the yeah and if theaccounts kind of smart contracts like
 all of the an activity and a the existing is one system just kind of getscut and pasted into eighth - and then
 the proof of work chain gets forgotten and then and things all the things thatwe're living there before you're just
 kind of continual living inside of the pro stake system so for timelines umphase zero has been kind of almost fully
 implemented and now it's just a matter of a whole bunch of security auditingand testing my own experience is that
 right now it feels like right about a phase comparable to when we were doingthe original aetherium launch when we
 were maybe about four months away from launch

Speaker 1 :that's just a hunch then that's just a


Speaker 0 :hunch yeah so how you know it took took


Speaker 1 :over a decade for people to move from
 Python to to Python 3 how do you see the move from like this phase of 0 of 4 fordifferent consistent mechanism do you
 see there being a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to thisbetter mechanism so in phase 0 don't


Speaker 0 :expect too many people to do much
 because in phase 0 in phase 1 then you chain negative deliberately and itdoesn't have too much functionality
 turned on it's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validatoryou can get things started if you want
 to store data for other blockchain applications you can get started butexisting applications will largely keep
 living on East one and then when the merger happens then the merger is aoperation that happens all at once I
 mean so instead of one of the benefits of I can sense a system that Nick on theone hand you have to coordinate the
 upgrade but on the other hand the upgrade can be coordinated so what's

Speaker 1 :Gasper FFG um Gasper FFG is their


Speaker 0 :consensus algorithm that we are using
 for other proofs take is there something

Speaker 1 :interesting specific about Casper FFG
 like some beautiful aspect of it that's

Speaker 0 :there is so in Casper FFG combines
 together kind of two different schools of a Kuznets algorithm design so thegeneral two different schools of the
 design are right one is at a 50% fault tolerant but dependent on networksynchrony so 50% faults are fault
 tolerant but it's all rate up to 50% of faults but not more but it depends on anassumption that all of the nodes can
 talk talk to each other within some development period of time like if Isend the message you'll receive it
 within a few seconds and the second of school is 33% fault tolerant but safeunder a synchrony which me instead like
 if we agree on something then that thing is finalized and even if the networkgoes horribly wonky the second after
 nothing is finalized there's no way to revert that thingand that's fascinating how you would


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :make that happen it's definitely quite
 clever I'd recommend the Casper FFG paper if you just search like archive Isaid like arxiv Casper FFG it's that's


Speaker 1 :the papers an archive yeah yeah who are


Speaker 0 :the authors myself and every Joel


Speaker 1 :Griffith that's awesome I take a small
 tangent this idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting themon archives just putting them publicly
 is it is that at the core is that a necessary component of cryptocurrenciesthat the tradition started with Satoshi
 nakamoto's what do you make of it like what do you make of the future of thatkind of sharing of ideas I guess so yeah


Speaker 0 :and it's definitely something that's
 like kind of mandatory for crypto because like crypto is all about makingsystems where you don't have to trust
 the operators to trust that the thing worksand so if anything behind our system
 works is closed sourced and that kind of kills the point and so there is the kindof a sense in which the fundamental
 properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build is just kind offorces openness but also openness just
 has proven to be a really great way to collaborate and there's actually a lotof n of innovation and academic
 collaboration that's just kind of happened ad hoc in the crypto space thelast few years so like for example we
 have this forum called the research that's like eth our ESEA are the dots ehand there we publish and of just ideas
 in a forum that's kind of half formal like it's halfway in between like it'sit's a kind of a text write up and then
 you can have math in it but it's the often--and of much shorter than a paperand it turns out that the great majority
 of new ideas like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets that you canexplain and like five to ten lines that
 they don't really need the whole

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :formality paper exactly they don't
 require the kind of like ten pages of an ax filler and so introduction conclusion

Speaker 1 :is not needed


Speaker 0 :yeah and so instead you just kind of
 published the idea and then people can go comments on it really yeah I saidgreat for us I think I interrupted you


Speaker 1 :was there something else on Casper


Speaker 0 :effigy that's like just Casper FFG is
 just kind of combines together these two schools and so basically it creates thissystem where if you have more than 50%
 that are honest then the and you have network synchrony then the thing kind ofgoes as a chain but then if network
 synchrony fails then kind of the last few blocks in the chain might be kind toget replaced but anything that was
 finalized by this side of more asynchronous process gets I can't bereverted and so you essentially get a
 kind of best of both worlds between those two models okay so I know what I'm

Speaker 1 :doing to them I'm currently reading the
 Casper effigy paper apologize for the romanticized question but what do youare some or the most beautiful idea in
 the world of aetherium just something surprising something beautiful something

Speaker 0 :powerful yeah I mean I think the fact
 that money can just emerge out of a database if enough people believe in itI think is definitely one of those
 things that's up there I think one of the things that I really love aboutaetherium is also this concept of
 composability so this is the idea that if I build an application on top ofethereum then you can build an
 application that talks to my application and you don't even need my permissionyou don't even need to talk to me right
 so one really fun example of this as there was this end of game on aetheriumcalled that Krypto kitties the just
 involve head of breeding digital cats yesand someone else created a game called
 crypto dragons where the way you play crypto dragons is you have a dragon andyou have to feed it crypto kitties and
 they just created the whole thing just like as an etherium contract that youwould send these these tokens that are
 defined by this other etherium contract for the interoperability to happen likethe project's didn't don't really need
 sir like the teams don't really need to talk to each other you just kind ofinterface with the existing program it's


Speaker 1 :just arbitrarily composable in this kind
 of ways you have different you know some groups they could be working and so youcould see it scaling to just outside of
 dragons and kitties it could be you build like entire ecosystems of software

Speaker 0 :yeah it's kind of mean especially in the
 decentralized finance space that's been popping up in the last two years there'sbeen a huge amount of really interesting
 things happen as a result of this is it

Speaker 1 :particularly kind of like financial
 applications kind of thing yeah I mean

Speaker 0 :there's like stable coins so this is a
 kind of tokens retain value I'm equal to $1 but they're kind of backed by cryptcryptocurrency then there's
 decentralized exchanges so when as far as the decentralized exchanges gothere's this really interesting
 construction that has existed for about one one and a half years they all calledyuna swap so what yuna swap is let's say
 a smart contract that holds imbalances of two tokens will call them token a andtoken B and it maintains that invariants
 that the balance of token a multiplied by the balance of token B has to equalthe same value and so the way that you
 trade against a thing is basically like you have this kind of curve you knowlike x times y equals K and yeah before
 you trade it's at some points on the curve after you tre you just like picksome different any to any other points
 on the curve and then whatever the Delta X is that's the amount of a tokens youprovide whatever the Delta Y is that's
 the amount of beads no case you get or vice versa and that's just and then andif the slope is I'm at the current
 points on the curve and it is the price and so that just is the whole thing andthat just allows you to have have this
 exchange for tokens and even if there's very few participants and the wholething is just like so simple and it's
 just very easy to set up very easy to participate in andit just provides so much value to people


Speaker 1 :so and the the fundamental the the
 distributor application infrastructure allows that somehow yes so this is a

Speaker 0 :smart contract meeting this is all a
 computer program that's just running on areum smart contracts to her just

Speaker 1 :fascinating they are okay do you think
 cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day so what doyou think we're headed in terms of the
 role of currency the structure type of currency in the world I definitely

Speaker 0 :expect fiat currencies to continue to
 exist and continue to be strong and I definitely expect had a fiat currencystall so digitized have their own way
 over the next couple of decades

Speaker 1 :what's fiat currency by the way so just


Speaker 0 :like things like US dollars like dollars
 and euros and Yemen these other things

Speaker 1 :and they're backed by government's yes


Speaker 0 :but I also expect and if
 cryptocurrencies to play the set of important role in just making sure thatpeople always have an alternative if
 fiat currency start breaking so like if or if you're in you know some had a veryhigh inflation place like Venezuela for
 example or if you're my country just kind of gets cut off from like cut offfrom other financial systems because of
 like something the banks do a gift for any kind of if there's even like somemajor trade disruption or something
 worse happens then like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing that just becauseof their kind of global neutrality they
 were just and of always there and you can keep using them it's interesting

Speaker 1 :that you're quite humble about the
 possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency you don't think there's apossible future where it becomes the
 main set of currency because it feels like fear it feels like the centralizedcontrol by governments of currencies
 limiting somehow maybe my naive utopian

Speaker 0 :view of the world it's a and it's
 definitely very possible I'm I think for cryptocurrencies being themain form of value to and of work well
 like did you need to have some much more price stability than they have today andI mean there are now stable coins and
 there are kind of cryptic cryptocurrencies that try to be morestable than existing things like Bitcoin
 and ether but and that just is a tsamina kind of the main challenge do you think

Speaker 1 :oh that's do you think that's a
 characteristic of this just being the early days is such young concept in tenyears is nothing in the history of money


Speaker 0 :yeah I think it's a combination of two
 things right one is it's it's still early days but the other is a kind ofmore durable any kind of economic
 problem which is that demand for currency is volatile right because oflike recessions booms changes to
 technology lots of things and if people's demand for how much currencythey want to hold changes and if you
 have a currency that has a fixed supply then the change in demand has to beentirely expressed as a change in value
 of the currency and so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demandbecomes entirely translated into
 volatility and ahead of prices of things that updated in that currency but if youhave a currency where instead the supply
 can change and so the supply can even go up when there's more demands then youhave the supply and of absorbing more of
 that volatility and so the price of the currency what absorb lost some of thevolatility on that topic so Bitcoin does


Speaker 1 :have a limited supply specific things
 supply yes what's what's the idea and theorem doesn't but can you clarify justin the comment you just made is
 aetherium qualified to the kind of currency that you're talking about andbeing flexible in the supply it's a bit


Speaker 0 :more flexible but you know the thing
 that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible ina response to how valuable the currency
 is and and I'd recommend you know what get stable coins as well so like thingslike dye for example
 like baseball that Dai and whoa what's

Speaker 1 :stable coins is it a type of
 cryptocurrency it is the type of

Speaker 0 :cryptocurrency it's um a type of
 cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract one of these aetherium computerprograms that where the smart contract
 holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically look that people deposit andthen it issues diane's the reason why
 people deposit is because they wants to kind of go high leverage on their etherand so it kind of pairs these two sets
 have you use there's one that wants to bility and one that kind of wants extrarisk together with each other and it
 basically creates or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll bepaid that they have this asset that can
 that can be later converted back into ether but it specifically at the end ofthe one dollar rate and it has some kind


Speaker 1 :of stabilizing network offense yeah yeah


Speaker 0 :it has many kinds of stabilizing
 mechanisms in it that's fascinating okay this is this

Speaker 1 :world is awesome technically just from a
 scientific perspective is an awesome world that I often don't see from anoutsider's perspective what I often see
 is kind of maybe hype and a little bit if I may say so like Charlton ISM andyou don't often see at least for my
 outsider's perspective the beautiful science of it and the engineering of itme maybe
 is there a comments you can make of who to follow how to learn about this worldwithout being interrupted by the
 charlatans and the hyperbole in this

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :space I think you need to just know the


Speaker 0 :specific just people to follow like
 there's you know there's all there kind of the cryptographers and theresearchers and there's just like even
 just the etherium research crew like myself st. grad Danny Justin none of theother people are and then and if the
 academic cryptographers and I give you like before with this today I was atStanford and Stanford has the Center for
 watch research and of Dan Bonet this reallyfamous and great cryptographer was never
 running yet and there's a lot of other people there and there's people workingon necks your knowledge proof so for
 example and Zuko from a-z caches and of one other person that I get respectso I think if you follow the technicals
 you crawl along that yeah you just sit with your in-group and then look at the

Speaker 1 :academics de Beaune and so on and they
 just cautiously expand the network of people who fall yeah exactly and like if

Speaker 0 :someone seems to to self-promotional
 than just like remove them is there

Speaker 1 :books there so there's these white
 papers and we just discussed about about ideas being condensed into really smallparts is there books that are emerging
 that are kind of good introductory

Speaker 0 :material so for a historical ones and
 there's like Nathaniel poppers digital gold which is just about the history ofBitcoin there's like one and then
 Matthew Ising announced that there's one about the history of aetherium fortechnical ones in there's injurious
 Antonopoulos is mastering aetherium

Speaker 1 :great so let me ask you sort of sorry to
 pull back to the the idea of governments and decentralized currency you know

Speaker 0 :there's a tension between the


Speaker 1 :centralization of currency and the power
 of nations the power of governments you what's your sense about that tension canis there some rule for regulation of
 currency you yeah is there like is the government the enemy of digital currencyof distributed currency or can they be
 like cautious friends I mean I think the

Speaker 0 :one thing that people forget is that
 it's clearly not entirely an enemy because they think if there hadn't beenso much government regulation on and if
 centralized the issuing centralized digital currency is that likebe seeing things with people like Google
 and Facebook and Twitter just kind of issuing them left and right and thenlike if that was the case then
 decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people but theydefinitely would appeal to less people
 than today so even in that sense I think it's they clearly been more of a helpjust and if set the stage for the end of
 the existence as system of the sector in some ways but but also and I think someof both you know like there's definitely
 things that governments and if can do in some cases have done to I have hurt thespread of and of growth of a of
 blockchains there's things that they've done to helpand there in some cases definitely done
 a good job of and if going after fraudulent projects and they're goingafter some of the projects that have
 some of their enough craziest and most misleading marketing there's also thepossibility that governments will end up
 using block chains for a lot of different things like you knowgovernments do and they do a lot more
 than just regulating right but there is also the they have then if identityrecords and they have kind of like
 property registry is even this their own currency is like secure big lots ofdifferent kind of things that they're
 operating and there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those and they

Speaker 1 :can you know they can leverage
 technology do a lot of good for our societies it is a little unfortunatethat governments often lag behind in
 terms of their acceptance the leverage of technology if you look at theautonomous vehicle space AI in general
 they're they're a few years behind it'd be nice to help them catch up that's athat's that's the always ongoing problem
 you uh met Vladimir Putin to discuss the central experience a year you're born inthe world were you born Columbus


Speaker 0 :it's a city about 115 km/h


Speaker 1 :go I mean that's vitamin potent is a is
 a central figure in this part of the world so what was that like meeting

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :meeting him what was that experience


Speaker 0 :like he's taller and photos than in
 person yeah that's right he's five seven

Speaker 1 :I think five eight maybe yeah


Speaker 0 :unfortunately we didn't actually again
 have too much of a chance to talk to him like I managed to see him for about oneminute at the end of this meeting and I
 did get a chance to see a lot some of the other end of government ministersand he recommended some and some of them
 are actually and if interested in trying to use blockchains to look for variousgovernment use cases the kind of a
 little bit corruption and other things and I have like it's hard to tell fromone conversation kind of what things are
 genuine and what things are just like Oh blotchiness cool let's do blockchainright but you know when I when I listen


Speaker 1 :to like Barack Obama talk about
 artificial intelligence there's certain things I hear were okay so he might notbe an expert in AI but he know he like
 actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he internal likeeven if it's just reading a Wikipedia
 page huh like you really thought about what this technology means did you get asense that Putin or some of the
 ministers like thought about blockchain like thought about the fundamentals it'slike know like understand it intuitively
 or they to old school to try to grasp it

Speaker 0 :some are old school some are more new
 school it depends it's definitely depends onwho you talk to
 I mean that's an open question for me

Speaker 1 :from with Putin because witness said


Speaker 0 :yeah I don't know I've only talked to
 him for about one minute so but

Speaker 1 :sometimes you can pick up sort of
 insights there's a quick comment there there about maybe you can correct me onthis but they're about 3,000
 cryptocurrencies being actively traded

Speaker 0 :yes and aetherium is one of you know a


Speaker 1 :lot of people believe that there will be
 the the Cryptococcus i think bitcoin iscurrently still the main cup to consoles
 but out there and very likely might become that the the main one is thiskind of diversity good in the crypto
 world DC is sticking around should though should there be a winner likeshould there be some consensus globally
 around bitcoin or around a theory and like what's your what's your sense i

Speaker 0 :havent nobody think of the diversity is
 good and i definitely i think also that there's probably too many people tryingto make separate block chains so and if
 right now i mean the number should definitely be greater than one andprobably greater than two or even five
 not three thousand not three thousand yeah and also not even like fortyhigh-quality platforms that try to do
 the same thing i mean there's definitely this range from just like one person whowould just like wrongly thinks that you
 can create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours and doesn't even think about kindof the community aspects of maintaining
 it going to people actually trying but only creating a really tiny one - likescammers to people like making something
 that's actually successful and then you know there's a lot of differentcategories of blockchain then you have
 project in terms of what it's trying to do in what applications it's for um andI think the experimentation is
 definitely healthy if you look at the

Speaker 1 :two world there might be a little bit
 disjoints but the distributed applications cryptocurrency and in theworld of artificial intelligence do you
 see there's some overlap between these worlds that both worried aboutcentralized control is there some
 overlap that's interesting that you think about do you think about AI much

Speaker 0 :yeah and I think definitely would have
 thought about things like like the AI and if control problems and a lot ofproblems and all of those things do you
 worry about the existential threat of AI

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :it's definitely one of the things I
 worry about you think block there's a lot of kind of common challenges becausein in both cases when you're ultimately
 trying to do is you're trying to kind of get a simplesystem to direct a more complex system
 like in the case of this as strong AI as the idea would be that this simplesystem is people and the complex system
 is well whatever thing the people the people end up and if unleashing on inthe universe that'll hopefully be a
 great thing and in the case of vlog chains and of the complex well thesimple thing is the algorithm which is a
 piece of static and Foley open source code and the more complex thing is justthen um all of the different possible
 and if human actors and if the strategy is that they yet might end up be used toparticipate in the network mmm do you


Speaker 1 :think about your own mortality like what
 you hope to accomplish in your life and

Speaker 0 :no I definitely I definitely think about
 anything my own mortality so that's if I

Speaker 1 :give you the option to live forever
 would you it depends a lot on what the

Speaker 0 :fine birds is you know if it's one of
 those things where I'm gonna be a kind of like floating through empty space for10 to the 75 years than know if it's
 forever worth of and of having you know for fulfilling life with a new meaningflood with with friends tend to spend
 the time with we're gonna meaningful challenges to explore and and eventuallyinteresting things to be working on then
 I think the absolutely move as

Speaker 1 :beautifully put live forever but you'd
 have to check the fine print mmm I think there's no better way to end itVitalik thank you so much for talking is
 so exciting to follow your work my distance and thank you for creating arevolutionary idea and sticking with it
