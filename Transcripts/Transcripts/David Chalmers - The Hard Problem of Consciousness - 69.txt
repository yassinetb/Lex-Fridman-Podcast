Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 David Chalmers he's a philosopher and cognitive scientist specializing in theareas of philosophy of mind
 philosophy language and consciousness he's perhaps best known for formulatingthe hard problem of consciousness which
 could be stated as why does the feeling which accompanies awareness of sensoryinformation exists at all consciousness
 is almost entirely mystery many people who worry about AI safety in ethicsbelieve that in some form consciousness
 can and should be engineered into AI systems of the future so while there'smuch mystery disagreement and
 discoveries yet to be made about consciousness these conversations whilefundamentally philosophical in nature
 may nevertheless be very important for engineers of modern AI systems to engagein this is the artificial intelligence

Speaker 0 :living in a simulation I don't rule it
 out there's probably going to be a lot of simulations in the history of thecosmos if the simulation is designed
 well enough it'll be indistinguishable from a non simulated reality andalthough we could keep searching for
 evidence that were not in a simulation any of that evidence in principle couldbe simulated so I think it's a


Speaker 1 :possibility but do you think the thought
 experiment is interesting or useful to calibrate how we think about the nature

Speaker 0 :of reality yeah I definitely think it's
 interesting and useful in fact I'm actually writing a book about this rightnow all about the simulation idea using
 it to shed light on a whole bunch of philosophical questions so you know thebig one is how do we know anything about
 the external world Descartes said you know maybe you're being fooled by anevil demon who's stimulating your brain
 and thinking all this stuff is real when in fact it's all made up well the modernthe modern version of that is how do you
 know you're not in a simulation then the thought is if you're in a simulationnone of this is real
 so that's teaching you something to give out about knowledge how do you knowabout the external world I think there's
 also really interesting questions about the nature of reality right here I meanif we are in a simulation is all this
 real is there really a table here is itreally a microphone do I really have a
 body the standard view would be no we don't none of this would be real my viewis actually that's wrong and even if we
 are in a simulation all of this is real that's why I calledthis reality 2.0 new version of reality
 different version of reality still

Speaker 1 :reality so what's the difference between
 quote-unquote real world and the world that we perceive so that we interactwith the world to the world by
 perceiving it it only really exists through the window of our perceptionsystem and in our mind so
 differs means something that's quote-unquote real that exists perhapswithout us being there and and the the
 world a as you perceive it well the

Speaker 0 :world as we perceive it as a very
 simplified and distorted version of what's going on underneath we alreadyknow that from just thinking about
 science you know you don't see too many obviously quantum mechanical effects andwhat we what we perceive but we still
 know quantum mechanics is going on under all things so I like to think the worldwe perceive is this very kind of
 simplified picture of colors and shapes existing and in space and so on we knowthere's a that's what the philosopher
 Wilfrid Sellars called the manifest image the world as it seems to us wealready know underneath all that is a
 very different scientific image with atoms or quantum wave functions or superstrings or whatever the the latest thing
 is and that's the ultimate scientific reality so I think of the simulationidea as basically another hypothesis
 about what the ultimate se quasi scientific or metaphysical reality isgoing on underneath the world with a
 manifest image the world of the manifest image is this very simple thing that weinteract with it's neutral on the
 underlying stuff of reality science could help tell us about that maybephilosophy could help tell us about that
 - and if we eventually take the red pill and find out we're in a simulation in myview is that's just another view about
 what reality is made of you know the philosopher Immanuel Kant said what isthe nature of the thing in itself I've
 got a glass here and it's got all these it appears to me a certain way a certainshape it's liquid it's clear and he said
 what is the nature of the thing and itself well I think of the simulationidea it's a hypothesis about the nature
 of the thing in itself it turns out if we're in a simulation the thing initself nature of this glass okay it's
 actually a bunch of data structures running on a on a computer in the next

Speaker 1 :universe up yeah that's what people tend
 to do and they think about simulation they think about our modern computersand somehow trivially crudely just
 scaled up and but do you think the simulation I meanin order to actually simulate something
 as complicated as our universe that's made up of molecules and atoms andparticles and quarks and maybe even
 strings all of that requires something just infinitely many orders of magnitudemore of scale and complexity do you
 think we're even able to even like conceptualize what it would take tosimulate our universe or does it just
 slip into this idea that you basically have to build a universe something sobig to simulate it is that it just get
 this into this fuzzy area that's not

Speaker 0 :useful at all yeah well obviously I mean
 our universe is obviously incredibly complicated and for us within ouruniverse to build a simulation of a
 universe as complicated as ours is gonna have obvious problems here if theuniverse is finite there's just no way
 that's gonna work maybe there's some cute way to make it work if the universeis a is a is infinite maybe an infinite
 universe could somehow simulate a copy of itself but that's a that's gonna behard
 nonetheless just that we are in a simulation I think there's no particularreason why we have to think the
 simulating universe has to be anything

Speaker 1 :like ours you've said before that it


Speaker 0 :might be so you can think of it and


Speaker 1 :Turtles all the way down you could think
 of the simulating universe different than ours but we ourselves could alsocreate another simulating universe so
 you said there could be these kind of levels of universes and you've alsomentioned this hilarious idea maybe
 tongue-in-cheek maybe not that there may be simulations within simulationsarbitrarily stacked levels and that
 there may be that we may be in level 42 oh yeah along those stacks referencingHitchhiker's Guide to the universe if
 we're indeed in a simulation within a simulation at level 42 what do you thinklevel zero looks like there right would


Speaker 0 :expect that
 zero is truly enormous I mean not just if it's finite it's some extraordinarilylarge finite capacity much more likely
 its infinite maybe it's a maybe it's got something very high etcetera tocardinalities that enables it to support
 just any number of any number of simulations so high degree of infinityat level zero slight little slightly
 smaller degree of infinity at at level one so by the time you get down to us atlevel 42 maybe plenty of room for lots
 of simulations of finite capacity if the top universe is only a small finitecapacity then obviously that's going to
 put very very serious limits on how many simulations are going to be able to beable to get running so I think we can
 certainly confidently say that if we hurt level 42 then the top level ispretty pretty damn big so it gets more


Speaker 1 :and more constrained as we get down
 levels more and more simplified and constrained and limited resources and

Speaker 0 :you know we still have plenty of
 capacity here what was it a Fineman 30 said there's plenty of room at thebottom you know we're still you know
 we're still a number of levels above the degree where there's room forfundamental computing physical computing
 capacity quantum computing capacity at the bottom level so we got plenty ofroom to play with and make we probably
 have plenty of room for simulations of pretty sophisticated universes perhapsnone as complicated as our universe
 unless our universes is infinite but still it's very least for pretty seriousfinite universes but maybe universes
 somewhat simpler than ours unless of course we're prepared to take certainshortcuts in the simulation which might
 then increase their capacity significantly do you think the the human

Speaker 1 :mind us people in terms of the
 complexity of simulation as at the height of what the simulation might beable to achieve like if you look at
 incredible entities that could be created in this universe of ours do youhave an intuition about how incredible
 human beings are on that scale I think

Speaker 0 :we're pretty impressive
 we're not that impressive are we above

Speaker 1 :average


Speaker 0 :I mean I think high human beings are a
 certain point in the scale of intelligence which made many thingspossible you know you get through
 evolution through single-cell organisms through fish and mammals and primatesand something happens once you get to
 human beings we've just reached that level where we get to develop languagewe get to develop certain kinds of
 culture or maybe get to develop certain kinds of collective thinking that hasenabled all this amazing stuff to happen
 science and literature and engineering and culture and and so on so we had justat the beginning of that on the
 evolutionary threshold it's kind of like we just got there you know who knows afew thousands or tens of thousands of
 years ago so we're probably just at the very beginning for what's possible thereso I'm inclined to think among the scale
 of intelligent beings we're somewhere very near the bottom I would expect thatfor example if we're in a if we're in a
 simulation then the simulators who created a sir got the capacity to be farmore sophisticated for at level 42 who
 knows what the ones at level zero I like

Speaker 1 :it's also possible that this is the
 epitome of what is possible to achieve so we as human beings see ourselvesmaybe as flawed see all the constraints
 all the limitations but maybe that's the magical the beautiful thingmaybe those limitations are the
 essential elements for an interesting sort of that edge of chaos thatinteresting existence that if you make
 us much more intelligent if if you make us much more powerful in any kind ofdimension of performance maybe you lose
 something fundamental that makes life worth living so you kind of have thisoptimistic view of where this little
 baby that and there's so much growth and potential but this could also be it wellthis is the most amazing thing is us


Speaker 0 :maybe what you're saying is consistent
 with what I'm saying I mean we can still have levels of intelligence far beyondus but maybe those levels of
 intelligence on your view would be kind of boring andyou know we get kind of get so good at
 everything that life suddenly becomes uni-dimensionalso we're just in happening in happening
 this once part of like maximal romanticism and history of evolution yesyou get to humans and it's like yeah and
 then years to come our super intelligent descendents are gonna look back at usand say those were the days when and
 they just hit the point of inflection and life was interesting I am anoptimist so I'd like to think that you
 know if there is super intelligence somewhere in the in the future they'llfigure out how to make life super
 interesting and super romantic when you know what they're gonna do it so what

Speaker 1 :they're gonna do is they realize how
 boring life is when you're super intelligent so they created a new levelof a simulation and sort of live through
 the things they've created by watching them stumble about in their flawed waysso maybe that's so you create a new
 level of a simulation every time you get really bored with how smart and this

Speaker 0 :would be kind of sad though because it
 would show the peak of their existence would be like watching simulations forentertainment by saying the peak of our
 existence now is Netflix know it's

Speaker 1 :alright a flipside of that could be the
 peak of our existence for many people having children and watching them growhmm that becomes very meaningful


Speaker 0 :okay so create a simulation it's like
 creating a family creating like well any

Speaker 1 :kind of creation is uh it's kind of a
 powerful act dealing is easier to simulate the mind or the universe soI've heard several people including Nick
 Bostrom think about ideas of you know maybe you don't need to simulate theuniverse you can just simulate the human
 mind or in general just the distinction between simulating this the entirety ofit the entirety the physical world or
 just simulating the mind which one do

Speaker 0 :you see is more challenging well I think
 in some sense the answer is is obvious it has to be simpler to simply simulatethe mind than to simulate the universe
 because the mind is part of the universe and in order to fully simulate theuniverse you're gonna have to simulate
 the mind's eye just by talking about partial simulations and I guess the

Speaker 1 :question is which comes first there's a
 mind come before the universe or does the universe come before the mindso the mind could just be an emergent
 phenomena in this universe so simulation is a is an interesting thing that youknow it's it's not like creating a
 simulation perhaps requires you to program every single thing that happensin it
 it's just defining a set of initial conditions and rules based on whichcould behaves mm-hmm simulating the mind
 requires you to have a little bit more we're now in a little bit of a crazy labbut it requires you to understand the
 fundamentals of cognition perhaps of consciousness of perception ofeverything like that that's me that's
 not created through some kind of emergence from basic physics laws butmore requires you to actually understand


Speaker 0 :the fundamentals of the mind how about
 if we said to simulate the brain the brain rather than rather than the mindthe brain is just a big physical system
 the universe is a giant physical system I simulate the universe at the veryleast you're going to have to simulate
 the brains as well as all the other physical systems within it and you knowit's not obvious there's that the
 problems are any worse for the for the brain than for its particularly complexphysical system but if we can simulate
 arbitrary physical systems we can simulate brains there is this furtherquestion of whether when you simulate a
 brain will that bring along all the features of the mind with it like willyou get my consciousness will you get
 thinking will you get free will and so on and that's that's somethingphilosophers ever have argued over for
 four years my own view is if you see if you simulate the brain well enough thatwill also simulate the mind but yeah
 there's plenty of people who would say no you'd merely get like a zombie systema simulation of a brain without any true


Speaker 1 :consciousness but for you you put
 together a brain the consciousness comes

Speaker 0 :with it arise yeah I don't think it's
 obvious that's your intuition my view is roughly that yeah what is responsiblefor consciousness it's in the patents of
 information processing and so on rather than say the biology that it's made ofthere's certainly plenty of people out
 there who think consciousness has to be say biological so if you merelyreplicate the patterns of information
 processing in a non-biological substrate you'll miss what's crucial forconsciousness I mean I think just don't
 think there's any particular reason to think that biology is special here youcan imagine substituting the biology for
 non biological systems a silicon circuits that play the same role thebehavior will continue to be the same
 and you know I think just the key about what is the true I when I think aboutthe connection the isomorphisms between
 consciousness and the brain the deepest connections to me seemed to connectconsciousness to patterns of information
 processing not specific biology so I at least adopted as my working hypothesisthat basically it's the computation and
 the information that matters for consciousness the same time we don'tunderstand consciousness it should be


Speaker 1 :wrong so the computation the flow the
 processing manipulation of information the the process is where theconsciousness the software is where the
 consciousness comes from not the

Speaker 0 :hardware roughly the software yeah the
 patterns of information processing at least in the in the hardware which wecould view as as software it may not be
 some of you just like program and load and erase and so on and the way we canwith ordinary software but it's
 something at the level of information processing rather than have a level ofimplementation so on that what do you


Speaker 1 :think of the experience of self just the
 experience of the world in a virtual world in virtual reality is it possiblethat we can create sort of offsprings of
 our consciousness by existing in a virtual world long enough so yeah ok canwe be conscious in in the same kind of
 deep way that we are in this real world by hanging out in a virtual world

Speaker 0 :yeah well the kind of virtual worlds we
 have now or you know or interesting but limited in certain ways in particularthey
 relying on us having a brain and so on which is outside the virtual world maybeI'll strap on my VR headset I'll just
 hang out in a in a virtual world on a on a screen but my brain and then thephysical my physical environment might
 be simulated if I'm in a virtual world but right now there's no attempt tosimulate my brain I might Hank there
 might be some non player characters and these are in these virtual worlds thathave simulated cognitive systems of
 certain kinds that dictate their behavior but you know mostly they'repretty simple right now I mean some
 people are trying to combine put a bit of AI and then non-player characters tomake them to make them them smarter but
 for now inside virtual world the actual thinking is interestingly distinct fromthe physics of those virtual worlds in a
 way actually I like to think this is kind of reminiscent of the way thatDescartes thought our physical world was
 there's physics and there's the mind and they're separate now we now we think themind is somehow somehow connected to
 physics pretty deeply but in these virtual worlds there's a physics of avirtual world and then there's this
 brain which is totally outside the virtual world that controls it andinteracts if when anyone anyone
 exercises agency in a video game and you know that's actually somebody outsidethe virtual world moving a controller
 controlling the interaction of things inside the virtual world so right now invirtual worlds the mind is somehow
 outside the world but you could imagine in the future once we get once we havedeveloped serious AI artificial general
 intelligence and so on then we could come to virtual worlds which have enoughsophistication you could actually
 simulate a brain or have a genuine AGI which were then presumably be able toact in equally sophisticated ways maybe
 even more sophisticated ways inside the virtual world to how it might in thephysical world and then the question is
 going to come along that would be kind of a VR into a virtual world internalintelligence and then the question is
 could they have consciousness experience intelligence free will yes all thethings that we have and again my view is
 I don't see why not

Speaker 1 :to linger in a little bit
 I find virtual reality really incredibly powerful just even the crude virtualreality we have now perhaps there's a
 there's a psychological effects that's makes some people more amenable tovirtual worlds and others but I find
 myself wanting to stay in virtual worlds

Speaker 0 :for free yes with a headset or on a
 desktop no with a headset really interesting because I I am totallyaddicted yet using the internet and
 things on a on a desktop but when it comes to VR for the headset I don'ttypically use it for more than 10 or 20
 minutes there's something just slightly aversive about it I find so I don'tright now even though I have oculus rift
 an oculus quest an HTC vive and Samsung listen that I want to stay in now forextended periods use you actually find
 yourself the something about him it's a

Speaker 1 :both a combination of just imagination
 and considering the possibilities of where this goes in in the future itfeels like I want to almost prepare my
 brain for like it I want to explore sort of Disneyland when it's first beingbuilt in the early days yeah and it
 feels like I'm walking around almost imagining the possibilities andsomething through that process allows my
 mind to really enter into that world but you say that the brain is external tothat virtual world it is strictly
 speaking true but if you're in VR and

Speaker 0 :you do brain surgery on an avatar and
 you can open up that skull what are you gonna find sorry nothing there nothingthe brain is elsewhere you don't think


Speaker 1 :it's possible to kind of separate them
 and I don't mean in a sense like decart like a hard separation but basically doyou think it's possible with the brain
 outside of the virtual grid when you're wearing a headset create a newconsciousness for prolonged periods of
 time really feel like really experience forget that human brain is outside so

Speaker 0 :this is okay this is gonna be the case
 where the brain is still outside still outside but could living in the VR Imean I mean we already find this right
 with video games exactly completely immersive and you gettaken up by living in those worlds and
 it becomes your reality for a while so

Speaker 1 :they're not completely immersive it's


Speaker 0 :very immersive you don't you don't
 forget the external world no exactly so

Speaker 1 :if that's what I'm asking yeah it's
 almost possible to really forget the external world really really immerse

Speaker 0 :yourself what to forget completely why
 would we forget you know we got pretty good memories maybe you can stop payingattention to the external world but you
 know that this already happens a lot I go to work and maybe I'm not payingattention to my home life if I go to s I
 go to a movie and I'm immersed in that so that degree of emotion absolutely butwe still have the capacity to remember
 it to completely forget the external world I'm thinking that would probablytake some I don't know some pretty
 serious drugs or something to make your s but it's to make your brain do that

Speaker 1 :possible so I mean I guess I'm getting
 at is consciousness a truly a property that's tied to the the physical brain or

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :can it can you create sort of different
 offspring copies of consciousness is based on the worlds that you enter well

Speaker 0 :the way we're doing it now at least with
 a standard VR there's just one brain interact for the physical world plays avideo game puts on a video headset
 interacts with this virtual world and I think we typically say there's oneconsciousness here that nonetheless
 undergoes different environments takes on different characters you know indifferent environments this is already
 something that happens in the non virtual world you know I might interactone way in my home life work life social
 life and so on so at the very least that will happen in a in a virtual world verynaturally people might people have very
 people sometimes adopt the character of avatars very different from themselvesmaybe even a different gender or
 different race different social backgroundso that much is certainly possible I
 would see that as a single consciousness is singing on different personas if youwant literal splitting of consciousness
 into multiple copies I think it's gonna take something more radical than thatlike maybe you can run different
 simulations of your brain in different realities and then expose them todifferent histories and then you know
 you just put yourself into 10 different simulated copies which then undergodifferent environments and then
 ultimately do become 10 very different consciousness maybe that could happenbut now we're not talking about
 something that's possible in the near term we're gonna have to have brainsimulations and AGI for that to happen


Speaker 1 :got it so before any of that happens
 it's fundamentally you see it as a singular consciousness even though it'sexperiencing different environments
 which are not it's still connected to same set of memories same set ofexperiences and therefore one sort of
 joint conscious system yeah or at least

Speaker 0 :no more multiple than the kind of
 multiple consciousness that we get from and have inhabiting differentenvironments and in a non virtual world


Speaker 1 :so you said as a child you were a music
 color Senna famously synesthete so we're songs had colors for youso what songs had what colors you know


Speaker 0 :this is funny um I didn't paint much
 attention to this at the time but I've listened to a piece of music and I'd getsome kind of imagery of a of a kind of a
 kind of color of the wid thing is mostly they were okay murky dark greens andolive browns and the colors went all
 that interesting I don't know what the reason is I mean my theory is that maybeit's like different cords and tones
 provided different colors and the old tended to get mixed together into thesesomewhat uninteresting browns and greens
 but every now and then there'd be something that had a really pure colorso this just a few that I did I remember
 it was a here there and everywhere by the Beatles was bright red and has thisyou know very distinctive tonality and
 it's chord structure at the at the beginnings of thatright red it was a song by the Alan
 Parsons Project called ammonia Avenue that was it was kind of a pure a pureblue anyway I've got no idea how would
 this happen didn't even pay that much attention until it went away when I wasabout 20 this synesthesia often goes


Speaker 1 :away so is it purely just the perception
 of a particular color or was there a positive or negative experience with itlike was blue associate with a positive
 and red with a negative or is it simply the perception of color associate withsome characteristic of the song for me I


Speaker 0 :don't remember a lot of association with
 with emotion or what the value was just this kind of weird and interesting factI mean at the beginning I thought this
 was something that happened to everyone songs have colors maybe I mentioned itonce or twice and people said no no ed
 it was like I thought was kind of cool when there was one that had one of theseespecially pure colors but only much
 later once I became a grad student thinking about the mind that I readabout this phenomenon called synesthesia
 it's like hey that's what I had and now I occasionally talk about it in myclasses in intro class and still happens
 sometimes a student comes up and says hey I have that I never knew about thatI never knew it had a name you said they


Speaker 1 :want to run away at age 20 or so and the
 you have a journal entry from around and saying songs don't have colors anymore

Speaker 0 :what happened what happened yeah I was
 definitely sad that it was gone in retrospect there's like hey that's coolthe colors have gone yeah do you can you


Speaker 1 :think about that for a little bit do you
 miss those experiences because it's a fundamentally different sets ofexperiences that you no longer have
 mm-hmm or deed or is it just a nice thing to have had you don't see them asthat fundamentally different than you
 visiting a new country and experiencing

Speaker 0 :new environments I guess for me when I
 had these experiences they were somewhat marginal they were like a little bonuskind of experience I know there are
 people have much more serious forms of synesthesia than this for whom it'sabsolutely central to their lives I know
 people who when they experience new people they have colors maybe they havetastes
 and so on every time they see writing it has it has colors some people wheneverthey hear music it's got a it's got a
 certain really rich color pattern and you know for some synesthetes it'sabsolutely central I think if they lost
 it they'd be devastated again for me it was a very very mild form of synesthesiait's like yeah it's like those
 interesting experiences yeah you know you might get under different alteredstates of consciousness and and so on
 it's kind of cool but you know not necessarily the single most important

Speaker 1 :experiences in your life so let's try to
 go to the very simplest question the events are bring you time but perhapsthe simplest things can help us reveal
 even in time some some new ideas so what in your view is consciousness what isqualia what is the hard problem of


Speaker 0 :consciousness consciousness I mean the
 word has used many ways but the kind of consciousness that I'm interested in isbasically subjective experience what it
 feels like from the inside to be a human being or any other conscious being Imean there's something it's like to be
 me right now I have visual images that I am experiencing I'm hearing my voiceI've got maybe some emotional tone I've
 got a stream of thoughts running through my head these are all things that Iexperience from the first-person point
 of view of sometimes called this the inner movie in the mind it's not aperfect it's not a perfect metaphor it's
 not like a movie in every ways and in every way and it's very rich but yeahit's just direct subjective experience
 and I call that consciousness or sometimes philosophers use the wordqualia which you suggested people tend
 to use the word qualia for things like the qualities of things like colorsredness the experience of redness versus
 the experience of greenness the experience of one taste or one smellversus another the experience of the
 quality of pain and a lot of consciousness is the experience of thoseof those those qualities of


Speaker 1 :consciousness is big
 the entirety of any kinds of extraneous

Speaker 0 :of thinking is not obviously qualia it's
 not like specific qualities like redness or greenness but still I'm thinkingabout my hometown I'm thinking about
 what I'm gonna do later on maybe there's still something running through my myhead which is subjective experience
 maybe it goes beyond those qualities or qualia philosophers sometimes use theword phenomenal consciousness for
 consciousness in this sense I mean people also talk about accessconsciousness being able to access
 information and your mind reflective consciousness being able tothink about yourself but it looks like
 the really mysterious one the one that really gets people going is phenomenalconsciousness the fact that all this the
 fact that the subjective experience and all this feels like something at all andthen the hard problem is how is it that
 why is it that there is phenomenal consciousness at all and how is it thatphysical processes in a brain could give
 you subjective experience it looks like try on the face of it you have all thisbig complicated physical system in a
 brain running and without a given subjective experience at all and yet wedo have subjective experience so the
 hard problem is just explained that

Speaker 1 :explain how that comes about we haven't
 been able to build machines work a red light goes on that says it's notconscious so how does how do we actually
 create that or how do humans do it and how do we ourselves do it we do every

Speaker 0 :now and then create machines that can do
 this you know we create babies yes that our that our conscious take out thesebrains asbestos brain does produce
 consciousness but even me even though we can't create it we still don'tunderstand when it happens maybe
 eventually we'll be able to create machines which as a matter of fact AImachines which as a matter of fact our
 conscious but that won't necessarily make the hard problem go away any morethan it does with babies because we
 still want to know how and why is it that these processes give youconsciousness you know you just made me


Speaker 1 :realize for a second maybe it's a
 totally dumb realization but nevertheless that it's a useful way tothink about
 the creation consciousness is looking at a baby so that there's a certain pointat which that baby is not conscious
 mm-hmm something sort of the baby starts from maybe I don't I don't know from afew cells right there's a certain point
 at which it becomes consciousness arrives it's conscious of course wecan't know exactly that line but that's
 a useful idea that we do we do create consciousness again a really dumb thingfor me to say but it not until now that
 I realized we do engineer consciousness we we get to watch the process happen wedon't know which point it happens or
 where it is but you know we do see the birth of consciousness yeah I mean

Speaker 0 :there's a question of course is whether
 babies are conscious when they're born and it used to be it seems at least somepeople thought they weren't which is why
 they didn't give anesthetics to newborn babies when they circumcised them and sonow people think oh that's you know be
 incredibly cruel yeah of course of course babies feel pain and now thedominant view is that the babies can
 feel pain I actually my partner of Claudia works on this whole issue ofwhether there's consciousness and babies
 and of what kind and she certainly thinks that newborn babies you know comeinto the world with some degree of
 consciousness because then you could just extend the question backwards tofetuses suddenly are too politically
 controversial exactly territory but you know there the question also arises inthe animal kingdom you know what where
 does consciousness start or stop is there a line in the animal kingdom whereyou know the first conscious organisms
 aren't it's interesting over time people are becoming more and more liberal aboutascribing consciousness to animals
 people used to think maybe only mammals could be conscious now most people seemto think show a fish are conscious they
 can feel pain and now we're arguing over insects you'll find people out there whosay plants have some degree of
 consciousness so you know who knows where it's gonna end the far end of thischain is the view that every physical
 system has some degree of consciousness philosophers call that pen sarcasmyou know I take that view I mean that's


Speaker 1 :a fascinating way to view reality so you
 could talk about if you can linger on pan psychism for a little bit what whatdoes it mean it's not just plants are
 conscious I mean it's that consciousness is a fundament the fabric of realitywhat does that mean to you how do we
 supposed to think about that

Speaker 0 :well we're used to the idea that some
 things in the world are fundamental right in physics like why we take thingslike space or time or space-time mass
 charge as fundamental properties of the universe you don't reduce them tosomething simpler you take those for
 granted you've got some laws that connect them here is how mass in spaceand time evolved theories like
 relativity or quantum mechanics or some future theory that will unify them bothbut everyone says you got to take some
 things as fundamental and if you can't explain one thing in terms of theprevious fundamental things you have to
 expand maybe something like this happen with Maxwell ended up with fundamentalprinciples of electromagnetism and took
 charge as fundamental because turned out that was the best way to explain it so Iat least take seriously the possibility
 something like that could happen with consciousness take it as a fundamentalproperty like space time and mass
 instead of trying to explain consciousness wholly in terms of theevolution of space-time and and mass and
 so on take it as a primitive and then connected to everything else by somefundamental laws because I mean there's
 basic there's this basic problem that the physics we have now looks great forsolving the easy problems of
 consciousness which are all about behavior strike they give us acomplicated structure and dynamics they
 tell us how things are going to behave what kind of observable behavior they'reproduced which is great for the problems
 of explaining how we walk and how we talk and so on those are the easyproblems of consciousness but the hard
 problem was this problem about subjective experience just doesn't looklike that kind of problem about
 structure or dynamics how things behave so it's hard to seeexisting physics is going to give you a
 full explanation of that certainly

Speaker 1 :trying to get a physics view of
 consciousness yes there there has to be a connecting point and it could be atthe very exome attic at the very
 beginning level but first of all there's a crazy idea that sort of everything hasproperties of consciousness there's a


Speaker 0 :would at that point the word


Speaker 1 :consciousness is already beyond the
 region of our current understanding like far because it's so far from at leastfor me maybe you can correct me it's far
 from the experience and the experiences that we have that I have as a humanbeing it to say that everything is
 cautious that means that means there that basically another way to put thatif if that's true then we understand
 almost nothing about that ask fundamental aspect of the world how do

Speaker 0 :you feel about saying an ant is
 conscious to get the same reaction to the head or is that something you canunderstand I can understand ant I can't


Speaker 1 :understand an atom applying chol plant


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so I'm comfortable with living things on
 earth mm-hmm being cautious because there's some kind of agency wherethere's similar size to me and they can
 be born and they can die and that is understandable intuitively of course youanthropomorphize you put yourself in the
 place of the plant but I can understand it I mean I'm I'm not like I don'tbelieve actually that plants are
 conscious of that plant suffer but I can understand that kind of belief that kind

Speaker 0 :of idea how do you feel how do you feel
 about robots like the kind of robots we have now if I told you like that youknow a Roomba at some degree of
 consciousness or some you know deep neural network I could understand that a

Speaker 1 :Roomba has coasters I just had spent all
 day at iRobot I and I mean I personally love robotsand have a deep connection with robots
 so I can I also probably enterpreneur Faiz them there's something about thephysical object so this difference than
 a neural network then you'll network running a software to me the physicalobject something about the human
 experience allows me to really see that physical object is an entity and if itmoves and moves in a way that it there's
 a like I didn't program it where it

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :feels that it's acting based on its own
 perception and yes self awareness and consciousness even if it's a Roomba thenyou start to assign it some agency some
 consciousness so but to say that Pan psychism that conscious is a fundamentalproperty of reality is a much bigger
 statement mm-hmm that it it's like Turtles all the way - yeah every is itdoesn't end and the whole thing is so
 like how I know it's full mystery but if you can linger on it and I go how wouldit how do you think about reality if
 consciousness is a fundamental part of its fabric the way you get there some

Speaker 0 :thinking can we explain consciousness
 given the existing fundamentals and then if you current is at least right now itlooks like then you've got to add
 something it doesn't follow that you have to add consciousness here's anotherinteresting possibility is we'll add
 something else that's called a proto consciousness or x-ray and then it turnsout space-time mass plus X will somehow
 collectively give you the possibility for for consciousness we don't rule outthat view either I call that pan proto
 psychism because maybe there's a some other property proto consciousness atthe bottom level and if you can't
 imagine there's actually genuine consciousness at the bottom level Ithink we should be open to the idea
 there's this other thing X maybe we can't imagine this somehow gives youconsciousness but if we are not playing
 along with the idea that there really is genuine consciousness at thelevel of course this is gonna be way out
 and speculative but you know at least in say if it was classical physics thenwe'd have to end up saying well every
 little half every with you a bunch of particles in space-time each of theseparticles has some kind of consciousness
 whose structure mirrors maybe their physical properties like its mass chargeits velocity and so on the structure of
 its consciousness would roughly correspond to that and the physicalinteractions between particles I mean
 there's this old worried about physics I mentioned this before in this issueabout the manifest image we don't really
 find out about the intrinsic nature of things physics tells us about how aparticle relates to other particles and
 interacts it doesn't tell us about what the particle is in itself that was can'tsing in itself so here's a view the
 nature in itself of a particle is something mental a particle is actuallya conscious a little conscious subject
 with with properties of its consciousness to correspond to itsphysical properties the laws of physics
 are actually ultimately relating these properties of conscious subjects on thisview a Newtonian world actually would be
 a vast collection of little conscious subjects at the bottom level way waysimpler than we are without free will or
 rationality or anything like that but that's what the universe would be likeof course that's a vastly speculative
 you know what no particular reason think is correct furthermore non Newtonianphysics say a quantum mechanical wave
 function suddenly a sort of difference on a vastcollection of conscious subjects may be
 the is ultimately one big wave function for the whole universe corresponding tothat might be something more like as a
 single conscious mind whose structure corresponds to the structure of the wavefunction people sometimes call this
 cosmos sarcasm and now of course we're in the realm of extremely speculativephilosophy there's no direct evidence
 for this but yeah but if you want a picture of what that universe would belike think yeah giant cosmic mind with
 enough richness and structure among it to replicate all the structure ofphysics


Speaker 1 :I think there
 I am at the level of particles and with quantum mechanics at the level of thewavefunction it's a it's kind of an
 exciting beautiful possibility of course way out of reach of physics currently it

Speaker 0 :is interesting that some neuroscientists
 our act begins to take pen psychism seriously you find consciousness even invery in very simple systems so for
 example the integrated information theory of consciousness a lot ofneuroscientists are taking seriously
 actually I just got this new book by Christophe cook just came in the feelingof life itself my consciousness is
 widespread but can't be computed he likes he basically endorses a pen Sarkisview where you get consciousness with
 the degree of information processing or integrated information processing in asimple in a system and even very very
 simple systems like a couple of particles will have some degree of thisso he ends up with some degree of
 consciousness in all matter and the claim is that this theory can actuallyexplain a bunch of stuff about the
 connection between the brain and consciousness now that's verycontroversial I think it's very very
 early days in the science of consciousness it's interesting the it'snot just philosophy that might lead you
 in this direction but there are ways of thinking quasi scientifically that leadsyou there too


Speaker 1 :but maybe different than pen psychism
 what do you think so Allen Watts has this quote I'd like to ask you about thequote is through our eyes the universe
 is perceiving itself through our ears universe is listening to its harmonieswe are the witnesses to which the
 universe becomes conscious of his glory of its magnificence so that's not pantspsychism do you think that we are
 essentially the tools the senses the universe created to be conscious of

Speaker 0 :itself it's an interesting idea of
 course if you went for the giant cosmic mind view then the universe wasconscious all along it didn't need us
 we're just little components of the universal consciousness likewise if youbelieve in penstock ism
 then there was some little degree of consciousness at the bottom level allalong and we were just more complex form
 of consciousness so I think maybe the quote you mentioned works better ifyou're not a pen Sarkis you're not a
 Cosmo Sarkis do you think consciousness just exists at this at this intermediatelevel and of course that's the Orthodox


Speaker 1 :view that you would say is the the
 common useless is your own view with pan psychism a rarer view I think it's

Speaker 0 :generally regarded certainly as a
 speculative view held by a fairly small minority of at least theoristsphilosophers most philosophers and most
 scientists who think about consciousness are not pants artists there's been a bitof a movement in that direction the last
 10 years or so it seems to be quite popular especially among the youngergeneration but it's still very
 definitely a minority view many people think is totally batshit crazy to usethe technical term the philosophical ter
 so the Orthodox view I think is still consciousness is something that humanshave and some good number of non-human
 animals have and maybe a eyes might have one day but it's restricted on that viewthen there was no consciousness at the
 start of universe there may be none at the end but it is this thing whichhappened at some point in the history of
 the universe consciousness developed and yes it's on that's a very amazing eventon this view because many people are
 inclined to think consciousness is what somehow gives meaning to our liveswithout consciousness
 there'd be no meaning no true value no good versus bad and so on so with theadvent of consciousness suddenly the
 universe went from meaningless to somehow meaningful why did this happen Iguess the quote you mentioned was
 somehow this was somehow destined to happen because the universe needed tohave consciousness within it to have
 value and have meaning and maybe you could combine that with a theistic viewor a teleological view the universe was
 inexorably evolving towards consciousness actually my colleague hereat NYU Tom Nagel wrote a book called
 mind and cosmos a few years ago where we arefor this teleological view of evolution
 toward consciousness saying this let the problems for Darwinism it's got amountain you know so it's very very
 controversial most people didn't agree I don't myself agree with thisteleological view but it is a it's at
 least a beautiful speculative view love the of the cosmos what do you think

Speaker 1 :people experience what do they seek when
 they believe in God from this kind of

Speaker 0 :perspective mm-hmm I'm not an expert on
 thinking about God and religion I'm not myself religious at all when people sort

Speaker 1 :of pray communicate with God word at
 which whatever form I'm not speaking to sort of the practices and the ritualsnon religion I mean the actual
 experience of that people really have a deep connection of God in some cases mhmwhat do you think that experience is
 it's so common at least throughout the history of civilization that it seemslike we seek that at the very least it's


Speaker 0 :an interesting conscious experience that
 people have when they experience religious or or prayer and so onneuroscientists have tried to examine
 what bits of the brain are active and so on but yeah that is this deeper questionof what is what are people looking for
 when they're doing this and like I said but no real expertise on this but itdoes seem the one thing people are after
 is a sense of meaning and value a sense of connection to something greater thanthemselves that will give their lives
 meaning and value and maybe the thought is if there is a God and God somehow isa universal consciousness who has
 invested this universe with meaning and some our connection to God might giveyour life meaning I got so I can kind of
 see the see the attractions of that but it still makes me wonder why is itexactly that a universal consciousness
 you know God would be needed to give the lot to give the worldif I mean if universal consciousness can
 give the world meaning why can't local consciousness give theworld meaning to so I think my
 consciousness gives my world is the

Speaker 1 :meaning is the origin of meaning vary


Speaker 0 :your world yeah I experience things as
 good or bad happy sad interesting important so my consciousness investsthis world with meaning without any
 consciousness maybe it would be a bleak meaningless universe but I don't see whyI need someone else's consciousness or
 even God's consciousness to give this this universe meaning here we are localcreatures with our own subjective
 experiences I think we can give the universe meaning ourselves so I meanmaybe just some people that feels
 inadequate yeah our own local consciousness is somehowtoo puny and insignificant to invest any
 of this with cosmic significance and maybe God gives you a sense of cosmicsignificance but I'm just speculating


Speaker 1 :here so the you know it's a really
 interesting idea that consciousness is the thing that makes life meaningful ifyou could maybe just just briefly
 explore that for a second so I suspect just from listening to you know you meanin an almost trivial sense just the
 day-to-day experiences of life have because of you attached identity to itmm-hmm
 they become oh I guess I want to ask something I I would always wanted to askCollege it Rock world renowned
 philosopher what is the meaning of life but I suspect you don't meanconsciousness gives any kind of greater
 meaning to it all yeah and more to day-to-day but is there greater meaning

Speaker 0 :to it all I think life has meaning for
 us because we are conscious so without consciousness no meaningconsciousness invests our life with
 meaning so consciousness is the source of my view of the meaning of life but Iwouldn't say consciousness
 self is the meaning of life I'd say what's meaningful in life is basicallywhat we find meaningful what we
 experience as meaningful so if you find meaning and fulfillment and value andsay intellectual work like understanding
 then that's your that's a very significant part of the meaning of lifefor you if you find it in social
 connections or in raising a family and that's the meaning of life for you themeaning kind of comes from what you
 value as a conscious creature so I think there's no you on this view there's nouniversal solution
 you know Universal answer to the question what is the meaning of life themeaning of life is where you find it as
 a conscious creature but it's consciousness that somehow makes valuepossible experiencing some things as
 good or as bad or as meaningful something comes from withinconsciousness so you think consciousness


Speaker 1 :is a crucial component ingredient of
 having given assigning value to things I

Speaker 0 :mean it's kind of a fairly strong
 intuition that without consciousness there wouldn't really be any value if wejust had a purely a universe of
 unconscious creatures would anything be better or worse than anything elsecertainly when it comes to ethical
 dilemmas you know you know about the older the old trolley problem do you youkill one person or do you switch to the
 other track to kill kill Fievel I got a variant on this their zombie trolleyproblem where there's one conscious
 being on on one track and five humanoid zombies let's make them robots yeah whoare not who are not conscious on the on
 the other track do you given that choice you kill the one conscious being or thefive unconscious robots most people have
 a fairly clear intuition here yeah kill the kill the unconscious beings becausethey basically they don't have a
 meaningful life they're not really persons conscious beings of course we

Speaker 1 :don't have good intuition about
 something like an unconscious being so in philosophical terms you refer to asAzzam
 mm-hmm it's a useful thought experiment construction in philosophical terms butwe don't yet have them so that's kind of
 what we may be able to create with robots and I don't necessarily know whatthat even means


Speaker 0 :yes merely hypothetical for now they're
 just a thought experiment they may never be possible I mean the extreme case of azombie is a being which is physically
 functionally behaviorally identical to me but not conscious that's a mirror Idon't think that could ever be built in
 this universe the question is just could we does that hypothetically make sensethat's kind of a useful contrast class
 to raise questions like why aren't we zombies how does it come about thatwe're conscious and we're not like that
 but there were less extreme versions of this like robots which are maybe notphysically identical to us maybe not
 even functionally identical to us maybe they've got a different architecture butthey can do a lot of sophisticated
 things maybe carry on a conversation but they're not conscious that's not so farout we've got simple computer systems
 these tending in that direction now and presumably this is gonna get more andmore sophisticated over years to come
 where we may have some pretty it's least quite straightforward to conceive ofsome pretty sophisticated robot systems
 that can use language and be fairly high functioning without consciousness at allthen I stipulate that I mean we've cost
 there's this tricky question of how you would know whether they're conscious butlet's say we've somehow solved that and
 we know that these high-functioning robots aren't conscious then thequestion is do they have moral status
 does it matter how we treat them like what is moral status means doesbasically society can they suffer
 doesn't matter how we treat them I would for example if we if I mistreat thisglass this cup by uh by shattering it
 then that's bad well why is it bad that was kind of make a mess it's gonna beannoying for me in my partner and so
 it's not bad for the cup no one would say the cup itself has moral statehey you you heard the cup and that's
 that's doing it a moral harm likewise plants will again if they'renot conscious most people think if by
 operating a plant you're not harming it but if a being is conscious on the otherhand then you are harming it so Siri or
 I dare not say the name of Alexa anyway we're so we don't think we're we'remorally harming Alexa by turning her off
 or disconnecting her or even destroying her whether it's the system or the orthe underlying software system because
 we don't really think she's conscious on the other hand you moved to it like thethe disembodied being in the moving in
 the movie her Samantha I guess she was kind of presented as conscious and thenif you if you destroyed her you'd
 certainly be committing a serious harm so I think how strong senses if a beingis conscious and can undergo subjective
 experiences that are matters morally how we treat them so if a robot is consciousit matters but if a robot is not
 conscious then they basically just meet or a machine and it and it and itdoesn't matter so I think at least maybe
 how we think about this stuff is fundamentally wrong but I think a lot ofpeople to think about this stuff
 seriously including people to think about say the moral treatment of animalsand so on come to the view that
 consciousness is ultimately kind of the line between systems that where we haveto take them into account in thinking
 morally about how we act and systems for which we don't and I think I've seen you

Speaker 1 :the writer talked about the
 demonstration of consciousness from a system like that from a system like Alexor a conversational agent that is what
 you would be looking for it's kind of at the very basic level for the system tohave an awareness that I'm just a
 program and yet why do I experience this or not to have that experience but tocommunicate that to you so that's what
 us humans would sound like if you all of a sudden woke up one daylike Kafka right in the body of a bug or
 something but in a computer you all sudden realize you don't have a body andyet you would feel what you're feeling
 you would probably say those kinds of things mm-hmmso do you think a system essentially
 becomes conscious by convincing us that it's conscious hmmthrough the words that I just mentioned
 so by being confused about the fact that why am I having these experiences wellso basically I don't think this is what


Speaker 0 :makes your conscious but I do think
 being puzzled about consciousness is a very good sign that a system isconscious so if I encountered a robot
 that actually seemed to be genuinely puzzled by its own mental states andsaying yeah I have all these weird
 experiences and I don't see how to explain them I know I'm a just a set ofsilicon circuits but I don't see how
 that would give you my consciousness I would at least take that as someevidence that there's some consciousness
 going on there I don't think a system needs to be puzzled about consciousnessto be conscious many people are puzzled
 by their consciousness animals don't seem to be puzzled at all I still thinkthey're conscious but I think that's a
 requirement on consciousness but I do think if we're looking for signs forconsciousness say in AI systems one of
 the things will help convince me that an AI system is consciousness if it showssigns of it if it shows signs of
 introspectively recognizing something like consciousness and finding thisphilosophically puzzling and the way
 that the way that that we do the

Speaker 1 :incision interesting thought though
 because a lot of people sort of would at the shower level criticize the Turingtest for language that it's essentially
 what I heard like Dan Dennett criticized it in this kind of way which is it'sreally puts a lot of emphasis on lying


Speaker 0 :yeah and being able to being able to
 imitate human beings yeah there's this a there's this cartoon of the AI systemstudying for the Turing test it's gotta
 be this book called talk like a human like man I don't have to waste my timelearning how to imitate humans
 maybe the AI system is gonna be way beyond the hard problem of consciousnessand it's gotta be this thing why do I
 need to waste my time pretending that I recognize the hard problem ofconsciousness - in order for people to
 recognize me as conscious yeah it just

Speaker 1 :feels like I guess the question is do
 you think there's a we can never really create a test for consciousness becauseit feels like we're very human centric
 and so the only way we would be convinced that something isconsciousness but is basically the thing
 demonstrates the illusion of consciousness that we can never reallyknow whether it's conscious or not and
 in fact that almost feels like it doesn't matter them or does it stillmatter to you that something is
 conscious or it demonstrates consciousness you still see thatfundamental distinction I think a lot of


Speaker 0 :people whether our system is conscious
 or not matters hugely for many things like how we treat it cannot suffer andso on but still that leaves open the
 question how can we ever know and it's true that it's awfully hard to see howwe can know for sure
 whether a system is conscious I suspect that sociologically the thing that'sgoing to convince us that the system is
 conscious is in part things like social interaction conversation and so on wherethey seem to be conscious they talk
 about their conscious state so I just talked about being happy or sad orfinding things meaningful or being in
 pain that will tend to convince us if we don't the system genuinely seems to beconscious we don't treat it as such
 eventually it's gonna seem like a strange form of racism or speciesism orsomehow not to acknowledge them and
 actually we believe that by the way I

Speaker 1 :believe that there is going to be
 something akin to the civil rights movement but for robots mm-hmmI think the moment you have a Roomba say
 please don't kick me that hurts just say it yeah I think they will fundamentallychange the fabric
 of our society I think you're probably

Speaker 0 :right although it's gonna be very tricky
 because just say where we've got the technology where these conscious beingscan just be moderated and multiplied by
 the thousands by flicking a switch so and the legal status is gonna bedifferent but ultimately the moral
 status ought to be the same and yeah the civil rights issue is gonna be a huge

Speaker 1 :mess so if one day somebody clones you
 another very real possibility in fact I find the conversation between two copiesof David Chalmers quite interesting


Speaker 0 :every thought he's not making any sense
 so what do you think he would be

Speaker 1 :cautious I do think he would be


Speaker 0 :conscious I do think in some sense not
 sure would be me there would be two different beings at this point I thinkthey both be conscious and they both
 have many of the same mental properties I think they both you know way have thesame moral status it'll be wrong to hurt
 either of them or they kill them and so on still there's some sense in whichprobably their legal status would have
 to be different if I am the original and that one's just a clone then you'recreating a clone of me presumably the
 clone doesn't for example automatically own the stuff that I own or you knowI've got a you know certain connect the
 things that the people I interact with my family my partner and so on and I'mgonna somehow be connected to them in a
 way in which the clone isn't so because

Speaker 1 :you came slightly first yeah but this


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :alone would argue yeah they have really
 as much of a connection they have all

Speaker 0 :the memories of that connection then
 away you might say it's kind of unfair to discriminate against them but sayyou've got an apartment that only one
 person can live in or a partner who only one person or why she didn't leave you

Speaker 1 :that's the original it's an interesting


Speaker 0 :philosophical question but you might say
 because I actually have this history if I am the same person there's a onethat came before and the clone is not
 that I have this history that the clone doesn't because there's also thequestion isn't the clone the same person
 - this is the question about personal identity if I continue and I create aclone over there I want to say this one
 is me and this one is is someone else but you could take the view that a cloneis equally me of course in a movie like
 Star Trek where they have a teletransport it basically createsclones all the time they treat the
 clones as if they're the original person of course they destroy the original bodyin Star Trek Isis there's only one left
 around and only very occasionally two things go wrong and you get two copiesof Captain Kirk it's somehow our legal
 system at the very least is gonna have to sort out some of these issues andthat maybe that's what's moral and watch
 League what's legally acceptable are gonna come apart what question would you

Speaker 1 :ask a clone of yourself yeah is there
 something useful II you can find out from him about the fundamentals of

Speaker 0 :cautiousness even I mean kind of in
 principle I know that if it's a perfect clone it's gonna behave just like me soI'm not sure I'm gonna be able to I
 could discover whether it's a perfect clone by seeing whether it answers likeme but otherwise I know what I'm gonna
 find is being which is just like me except that it's just undergone thisgreat shock of discovering that it's a
 clone so just so you woke me up tomorrow and said hey Dave sorry to tell you thisbut you're actually the clone and you
 provided be really convincing evidence should be the film of my being clonedand then all wrapped here being here and
 and waking up so you proved to me I'm a criminal yeah okay I would find thatshocking and who knows how I would react
 to this so so maybe by talking to the clone I'd find something about my ownpsychology but I can't find out so
 easily like how I'd react upon discovering that I'm a clone I couldcertainly ask the clone if it's
 conscious and what his consciousness is like and so on but I guess I kind ofknow if it's a perfect clone it's gonna
 behave roughly like me of course at the beginning there'll be aquestion about whether a perfect clone
 is possible so I may want to ask it lots of questions to see if it'sconsciousness and the way it talks about
 is consciousness and the way it reacts to things in general is like me and youknow that will occupy us for a it's a
 basic unit unit testing in the early

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :model yeah so you so if it's a perfect


Speaker 1 :clone you say there's gonna be --have
 exactly like you so that takes us to freewill mmm-hmm is there a free will

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :are we able to make decisions that are
 not predetermined from the initial conditions in the universe you know

Speaker 0 :philosophers do this annoying thing of
 saying it depends what you mean so in this case yeah really depends on whatyou mean by by freewill
 if you mean something which was not determined in advance could never havebeen determined then I don't know we
 have freewill I mean there's quantum mechanics andwho's to say if that opens up some room
 but I'm not sure we have freewill in that sense I'm also not sure that's thekind of freewill that really matters you
 know what matters to us is being able to do what we want and to create our ownfutures we've got this distinction
 between having our lives be under our control and under someone else's controlmethod we've got the sense of actions
 that we are responsible for versus ones that were not I think you can make thosedistinctions even in a deterministic
 universe and this is what people call the compatibilist view of freewill whereit's compatible with determinism I think
 for many purposes the kind of freewill that matters is something we can have ina deterministic universe and I can't see
 any reason in principle why an AI system couldn't have freewillof that kind if you mean super-duper
 freewill the ability to violate the laws of physics and doing things thatimprints of all could not be predicted I
 don't know maybe no one has that kind of freewill what's the connection between

Speaker 1 :the the reality of freewill and the
 experience of it the subjective experience in your view so how doesconsciousness connect to this to the
 experience to the reality in the experience of

Speaker 0 :feels certainly true that when we make
 decisions and when we choose and so on we feel like we have an open future yesfeel like I could do this I could go
 into philosophy or I could go into math I could go to a movie tonight I could goto restaurant so we experience these
 things as if the future is open and maybe we experience ourselves asexerting a kind of effect on the future
 that somehow picking out one path from many paths were previously open and youmight think that actually if we're in a
 deterministic universe there's a sense in which objectively those paths weren'treally open all along but subjectively
 they were open and that's I think that's what really matters in making adecisions were our experience of making
 a decision as choosing a path for for ourselves I mean in general ourintrospective models of the mind I think
 are generally very distorted representations of the mind so it maywell be that our experience of our self
 in making a decision experience of what's going on doesn't terribly wellmirror what's uh what's going on I mean
 you know maybe there are antecedents in the brain way before anything came intoconsciousness and and and so on
 those aren't represented in our introspective models so in general ourexperience of our experience of
 perception yes I experienced perceptual image of the external world it's not aterribly good model of what's actually
 going on in the in my visual cortex and so on which has all these layers and soon it's just one little snapshot of of
 one bit of that so in general yeah introspective models are very overoversimplified and it wouldn't be
 surprising if that was true of free will as wellthis also incidentally can be applied to
 consciousness itself there is this very interesting view that consciousnessitself is an introspective illusion in
 fact we're not conscious but we but weeks the brain just has theseintrospective models of itself or
 oversimplifies everything and represents itself as having these specialproperties of consciousness thing it's a
 really simple way to kind of keep track of it soand so on and then on The Illusionist
 view yeah that's just a that's just an illusion it was I find this view I findit implausible I do find it very
 attractive in some ways because it's easy to tell some story about how thebrain would create introspective models
 of its own consciousness of its own free will as a way of simplifying yourself Imean it's similar way when we perceive
 the external world we perceive it as having these colors that maybe itdoesn't really have because that's a
 really useful way of keeping tracks of keeping track did you say that you find

Speaker 1 :it not very plausible because I I
 thought I find it both plausible and attractive in some sense because it Imean that's that kind of view is one
 that has the minimum amount of mystery around ityou can kind of understand that kind of
 view everything else says we don't understand so much of this picture you

Speaker 0 :know it is four it is very attractive I
 recently wrote an article all about this kind of issue called the meta problem ofconsciousness the hard problem is how
 does the brain give you consciousness the meta problem is why are we puzzledby the hard problem of consciousness and
 because you know I'll being puzzled by it that's ultimately a bit of behaviorwe might be able to explain that bit of
 behavior as one of the easy problems consciousness so maybe there'll be somecomputational model that explains why
 we're puzzled by consciousness the meta problem has come up with that model andI've been thinking about that a lot
 lately there's some interesting stories you can tell about why the right kind ofcomputational system might develop these
 introspective models of itself that are attributed itself these specialproperties so that that meta problem is
 a resource fasten gram program for everyone and then if you've gotattraction to sort of simple views
 desert landscapes and so on then you can go all the way with what people callillusionism and say in fact
 consciousness itself is not real what Israel is just these these theseintrospective models we have that tell
 us that we're conscious so the view is very simple very attractive verypowerful the trouble is of course it has
 to say that deep down consciousness is not real we're not actually experiencingright now and it looks like it's just
 contradicting a fundamental datum of our existence and this is why most peoplefind this view crazy just as they find
 Pam sake as I'm crazy in one way people find illusionism crazy in another waybut it's I mean but it so yes it has to
 deny this fundamental datum of our existence now and the view that makesthe view soar frankly unbelievable for
 most people on the other hand the view develop right might be able to explainwhy we find it unbelievable
 because these modal's are so deeply hop right into our head and they're allintegrated so it's not you can't escape


Speaker 1 :that the the illusion and as the crazy
 possibility is it possible that the entirety of the universe our planet allthe people in New York all the organisms
 on our planet the including me here today are not real in in that sensethey're all part of an illusion inside
 of Dave Chalmers whose head I think all

Speaker 0 :this could be a simulation no but not


Speaker 1 :just a simulation yeah because the
 simulation kind of is outside of you I

Speaker 0 :mean what if it's all an illusion they


Speaker 1 :yes a dream that you are experiencing
 that's it's all in your mind right thank you is that can you takeillusionism that far well there's


Speaker 0 :illusionism about the external world and
 illusionism about consciousness and these might go in respective differentillusionism about the external world
 kind of takes you back to Descartes and yet could all this be produced by anevil demon they caught himself also had
 the dream argument he said how do you know you're not dreaming right now howdo you know this is not an amazing dream
 and it's at least a possibility that yeah this could be some super dupercomplex dream in the next universe up I
 guess so my attitude is that just as when a carthought that if the evil demon was doing
 it it's not real a lot of people these days say if a simulation is doing itit's not real as I was saying before I
 think even if it's a simulation that doesn't stop this is being real it justtells us what the world is made of black
 white if it's a dream it could turn out that all this is like my dream createdby my brain and the next universe up my
 own view is that wouldn't stop this physical world from being real wouldturn out this Cup at the most
 fundamental level was made of a bit of say my consciousness in the Dreamingmind at the next level up maybe that
 would give you a kind of weird kind of pants sarcasm about reality but itwouldn't show that the cup isn't real
 but just tell us it's ultimately made of processes in my dreaming mind so I'dresist the idea that if the physical
 world is a dream then it's an illusion

Speaker 1 :then it's right by the way perhaps you
 have an interesting thought about it why is there cards demon or geniusconsidered evil what couldn't have been
 a benevolent one I had the same powers

Speaker 0 :yeah I mean Dakota the Malheur genie the
 evil genie or evil genius malign I guess was the word but it's interestingquestion I mean a later philosophy
 Berkeley said no in fact all this is done by God God actually supply suppliesyou all of these all of these
 perceptions and ideas and that's how physical reality is sustainedinterestingly Barclays God is doing
 something that doesn't look so different from what des cartes evil demon wasdoing it's just that they can't thought
 it was deception and Berkeley thought it was not and I'm I'm actually mostsympathetic to Berkeley here yeah this
 evil demon may be trying to deceive you but I think okay well the evil demon mayjust be under the working under a false
 philosophical theory is deceiving you it's wrong it's like there's machines onthe matrix they thought they were
 deceiving you that all this stuff is real I think know if we're in a matrixit's all still it's all still real
 yeah the the philosopher ok booster I had a nice story about this about 50years ago about dick Hart's evil demon
 where he said this demon spends all its time trying to fool people but failsbecause I'm how old demon ends up doing
 is constructing realities for 4 people so yeah I think that maybe if it's avery natural to take this view that if
 we're in a simulation or or evil demon scenario or something then none of thisis real but I think it may be ultimately
 a philosophical mistake especially if you take on board sort of the view ofreality well what matters to reality is
 really its structure something like its mathematical structure and so on whichseems to be the view that a lot of
 people take from contemporary physics and looks like you can find all thatmathematical structure in a simulation
 maybe even in a dream and so on so as long as that structure is real I wouldsay that's enough for the physical world
 to be real yeah the physical world may turn out to be somewhat more intangiblethan we had thought and have a
 surprising nature of it we're already gotten very used to thatfrom for modern science see you've kind


Speaker 1 :of looted that you don't have to have
 consciousness for high levels of intelligence but to create truly generalintelligent systems gi systems at human
 level intelligence and perhaps superhuman level intelligence you'vetalked about that it you feel like that
 kind of thing might be very far away but nevertheless one we reached that pointdo you think consciousness from an
 engineering perspective is needed or at least highly beneficial for creating inthe a GI system yeah no one knows what


Speaker 0 :consciousness is for functionally so
 right now there's no specific thing we can point to and say you needconsciousness for that still my
 inclination is to believe that in principle AGI is possible at the veryleast I don't see why someone couldn't
 simulate a brain ultimately have a computational system that produces allof our behavior and if that's possible
 I'm sure vastly many other computational systems of equal or greaterfists ocation are possible for all of
 our cognitive functions and more my inclination is to think that once you'vegot all these cognitive functions you
 know perception attention reasoning introspection language emotion and so onit's very likely you'll have you'll have
 consciousness as well as this is very hard for me to see how you'd have asystem had all those things while
 bypassing somehow conscious so just

Speaker 1 :naturally it's integrated quite
 naturally there's a lot of overlap about the kind of function that required toachieve each of those things that's so
 you can't disentangle them even when

Speaker 0 :you're in us but we don't know what
 caused a role of consciousness in the physical world what it does I mean justsay it turns out consciousness does
 something very specific in the physical world like collapsing wave functions ason one common interpretation of quantum
 mechanics that all we might find someplace where it actually makes adifference and we could say uh here is
 where in collapsing wave functions it's driving the behavior of a system andmaybe it could even turn out that for a
 GI you'd need something playing that I mean if you wanted to connect this tofree will some people think
 consciousness collapsing wave functions that would be how the conscious mindexerts affect on the physical world and
 exerts its free will and maybe it could turn out that any AGI that didn'tutilize that mechanism would be limited
 in the kinds of functionality that have had I don't myself find that plausible Ithink probably that functionality could
 be simulated you could imagine once we had a very specific idea about the roleof consciousness in the physical world
 this would have some impact on the capacity of a GIS and if it was a rolethat could not be duplicated elsewhere
 then we have to find we did we have to find some way to either getconsciousness in the system to play that
 role or to simulate it if we can isolate

Speaker 1 :a particular role to consciousness of
 course that's incredibly seems like an incredibly difficult thing whatever

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :worries about X
 sensual threats of conscious intelligent beings that are not us though socertainly I'm sure you're worried about
 us yeah from an existential threat perspective but outside of us AI systemsthere's a couple of different kinds of


Speaker 0 :existential threats here one is an
 existential threat to consciousness generally I mean yes I care about humansand the survival of humans and so on but
 just say it turns out that that eventually we're replaced by someartificial beings around humans but are
 somehow our successes they still have good lives they still do interesting andwonderful things with the universe I
 don't think that's that's not so bad that's just our successors we were onestage in evolution something different
 maybe better came next if on the other hand all of consciousness was wiped outthat would be a very serious moral
 disaster one way that could happen is by all intelligent life being wiped out andmany people think that yeah once you get
 to humans and AI is an amazing sophistication where everyone has gotthe the ability to create weapons that
 can destroy the whole universe just by just by pressing a button then maybeit's inevitable all intelligent life
 will will die out that would be a that would certainly be a disaster and we'vegot to think very hard about how to
 avoid that but yeah another interesting kind of disaster is that may beintelligent life is not wiped out but
 all consciousness is wiped out so just say you thought unlike what I was sayinga moment ago that there are two
 different kinds of intelligent systems some which are conscious and some whichare some which are not and just say it
 turns out that we create AGI with with higher degree of intelligence meaninghigher degree of sophistication and
 that's behavior but with no consciousness at all that AGI could takeover the world maybe but then there be
 but let there be no consciousness in this world this would be a world ofzombies some people have called this the
 zombie apocalypse because it's consciousness consciousness is goneyou've merely got this
 / intelligent non-conscious robots and I would say that's a moral disaster in thesame way in almost the same way that the
 world with no intelligent life is a moral disaster all value and meaning maybe gone from from that world so these
 are both threats to watch out for now my own view is if you get superintelligence you're almost certainly
 going to bring consciousness with it so I hope that's not gonna happen but ofcourse I don't understand consciousness
 no one understands consciousness this is one reason for this is one reason atleast among many for thinking very
 seriously about consciousness and thinking about the kind of future wewant to create with a you know city in a
 world with humans and or AI how do you

Speaker 1 :feel about the possibility of
 consciousness so naturally does come with a GI systems that we are just astep in the evolution that will be just
 something a blimp on the record that be studied in books by the a GI systemscenturies from now I mean I think I'd


Speaker 0 :probably be ok with that
 especially if somehow humans are continuous with AG eyes I mean I thinksomething like this is inevitable the
 very least humans are gonna be transformed we're gonna be augmented bytechnology that's already happening in
 all kinds of ways we're gonna be transformed by technology where ourbrains are gonna be uploaded and
 computationally enhanced and eventually that line between what's a human andwhat's a what's an AI maybe kind of hard
 to hard to draw how much does it matter for example that some future being athousand years from now that somehow
 descended from us actually still has biology I think it would be nice if youkind of point to its cognitive system to
 point to some past that had some roots in us and chaser trace a continuous linethere that would be selfishly nice for
 me to think that ok I'm connected to this thread line through the future ofthe world but if it turns out ok there's
 a jump there they'd if they found a better way to design cognitive systemsthey designed a wholly new kind of thing
 and the only line is some causal chain of designing and systems that designbetter systems is that so much worse I
 don't know still at least part of a causal chain ofdesign and yes they're not humans but
 still they're our successes ultimately I think it's probably inevitable thatsomething like that will happen at least
 we were at least we were part of the process it'll be nice if they stillcared enough about us to you know maybe
 to engage with our arguments I'm really hoping that the Agis are gonna solve allthe problems of philosophy they'll come
 back and read all this all this crap for the 20th and 21st century hard problemof consciousness and here is why they
 got it wrong and so and if that happened then I'd really feel like I was part ofat least a intellectual process over
 centuries and that would be kind of cool I'm pretty sure they would clone or they

Speaker 1 :would recreate David Chalmers and for
 the fun of it sort of bring back other philosophy a car the garden and just put

Speaker 0 :them in a room he's just watch it'll be


Speaker 1 :a Netflix of the future show will you
 bring philosophers from different human 100% human philosophers from previousgenerations put them in a room and see
 them

Speaker 0 :I am totally I'm totally up for that
 simulators AG eyes of the future if you're watching who that would like tobe recreated and who wouldn't be cut
 with the car it would be the first

Speaker 1 :hangout as part of such a TV show with a
 philosopher that's no longer with us from long ago who would it who would you

Speaker 0 :choose dick count would have to be right
 up there oh actually a couple of months ago I got to have a conversation withdick Hart an actor who's actually a
 philosopher came out on stage playing Descartes I didn't know this was gonnahappen and I just after I gave a talk
 and a bit of a surreal my ideas were crap and all drive from him and so Imade along with a long argument this was
 great no I would love to see what Descartes would think about AI forexample and modern neuroscience and so
 on I suspect not too much would surprise him but that ya William James you knowfor psychologists of consciousness I
 think James was probably the was probably the the richest but oh thereare manual cars you know I never really
 understood when is up to if I got to actually talk tohim about some of this hey it was
 Princess Elizabeth who talked with Descartes and who really you know gotother problems of how they carts ideas
 of a non-physical mind interacting with the with the the physical body couldn'treally work she's been kind of most
 philosophers think she's been proved right so maybe put me in a room withDescartes and Princess Elizabeth and we
 can all argue it out what kind of

Speaker 1 :feature so we talked about was zombies a
 concerning future but what kind of future excites you what do you think ifwe look forward sort of we're at the
 very early stages of understanding consciousness and we're now at the earlystages of being able to engineer complex
 interesting systems that have degrees of intelligence maybe one day we'll havedegrees of consciousness maybe be able
 to upload brains all those possibilities virtual reality what is there aparticular aspect of this future world
 that just excites you I think there are

Speaker 0 :lots of different aspects I mean frankly
 I want it to hurry up and half us like yeah we've had some progress lately anAI and VR but in the grand scheme of
 things it's still kind of slow the changes are not yet transformative andyou know I'm in my 50s I've only got so
 long left I'd like I'd like to see really serious AI in my lifetime andreally serious virtual worlds because
 yeah once people are I would like to be able to hang out in a virtual realitywhich is richer then then then this
 reality to really get to inhabit fundamentally different kinds of spaceswell I would very much like to be able
 to upload my mind onto a onto a computer so maybe I don't have to die if this ismaybe gradually replace my neurons with
 silicon chips and I'd have it like a few selfishly that would be that would bewonderful I suspect I'm not going to
 quite get there in a in my lifetime but once that's possible then you've got thepossibility of transforming your
 consciousness in remarkable ways or renting it enhancing it

Speaker 1 :so let me ask them if such a system is a
 possibility within your lifetime and you were given the opportunity to becomeimmortal in this kind of way would you
 choose to be immortal yes I totally

Speaker 0 :would I know some people say they
 couldn't it would be awful to be a to be immortal be so boring or something Idon't see I really don't see a don't see
 why this might be I mean even if it's just ordinary life that continuesordinary life is not so bad but
 furthermore I kind of suspect that you know if the universe is gonna go onforever or indefinitely it's going to
 continue to be interesting it I don't think yeah your view was that we justhit this one romantic point of interest
 now and afterwards it's all gonna be boring super-intelligent stasis I guessmy vision is more like no it's gonna
 continue to be infinitely interesting something like as you go up the settheoretic hierarchy you know you go from
 the the finite car finite Cardinals to Aleph zero and thenthrough there to all the Aleph one and I
 love two and maybe the continuum and you keep taking power sets and you know inset theory they've got these results
 that actually all this is fundamentally unpredictable it doesn't follow anysimple computational patterns there's
 new levels of creativity as the set theoretic universe expands and expands Iguess that's my future that's my vision
 of the future that's my optimistic vision of thefuture of superintelligence it will keep
 expanding and keep growing but still being fundamentally unpredictable atmany points I mean yes this gets creates
 all kinds of worries like couldn't it all be fragile and be destroyed at anypoint so we're gonna need a solution to
 that problem if we get to stipulate that I'm immortal well I hope that I'm notjust immortal and stuck in the single
 world forever but I'm immortal and get to take part in this process of goingthrough infinitely rich created futures
 rich unpredictable exciting well I think

Speaker 1 :I speak for a lot of people in saying I
 hope you do become immortal and there'll be that Netflix show the future whereyou get to argue with
 Descartes perhaps for all eternity so David was an honor thank you so much fortalking today thanks it was a pleasure
