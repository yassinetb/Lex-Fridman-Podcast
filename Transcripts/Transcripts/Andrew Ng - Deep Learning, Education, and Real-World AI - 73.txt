 education for young people around the

Speaker 1 :world


Speaker 0 :and now here's my conversation with
 Andrew Eng the courses you taught on machine learning in Stanford and lateron Coursera the co-founded have educated
 and inspired millions of people so let me ask you what people are ideasinspired you to get into computer
 science and machine learning when you were young when did you first fall inlove with the field there's another way


Speaker 1 :to put it
 growing up in Hong Kong Singapore I started learning to code when I was fiveor six years old at that time I was
 learning the basic programming language and they would take these folks and youknow they'll tell you typed this program
 into your computer so typed that programs my computer and as a result ofall that typing I would get to play
 these very simple shoot-'em-up games that you know I had implemented on myown minds old computer so I thought was
 fascinating as a young kid that I could write this code that's really justcopying code from a book into my
 computer to then play these cool of video games another moment for me waswhen I was a teenager and my father
 because his doctor was reading about expert systems and about neural networksso he got me read some of these books
 and I thought was really cool you could write a computer that started to exhibitintelligence then I remember doing an
 internship was in high school this isn't Singapore where I remember doing a lotof photocopying and and I was office
 assistants and the highlight of my job was when I got to use the shredderso the teenager me remote thinking boy
 this is a lot of photocopying if only we could write software build a robotsomething to automate this maybe I could
 do something else so I think a lot of my work since then has centered on thetheme of automation even the way I think
 about machine learning today were very good at writing learning algorithms theycan automate things that people can do
 or even launching the first MOOCs massive open online courses that laterled to Coursera I was trying to also
 meet what could be automatable in how I was teaching on campus process of

Speaker 0 :Education tried to automate parts of
 that make it more to have more impact from a single

Speaker 1 :teacher single educator yeah I felt you
 know teaching Stanford teaching machine learning it's about 400 students a yearat the time and I found myself filming
 the exact same video every year telling the same jokes the same room and Ithought why am I doing this well just
 take last year's video and then I can spend my time building a deeperrelationship with students so he has
 process of thinking through how to do that that led to the first first moves

Speaker 0 :that we launched and then you have more
 time to write new jokes are their favorite memories from your early daysat Stanford teaching thousands of people
 in person and then millions of people

Speaker 1 :online you know teaching online
 what not many people know was that a lot of those videos were shot between thehours of 10:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. a lot
 of times we were watching the first moves that fit with our announcer coursebut a hundred thousand people have
 signed up we just started to write the code and we had not yet actually filmedthe video so you know a lot of pressure
 a hundred thousand people waiting for us to produce the content so many FridaySaturday's I would go out have dinner my
 friends and then I was thinking okay do I want to go home now or do you want togo to the office to film videos and the
 thoughts of you know that helped hundred thousand people potentially learnmachine learning unfortunately that made
 me think okay I'm gonna go to my office go to my time in the recording studio Iwould adjust my Logitech webcam adjust
 my you know Wacom tablet make sure my lapel mic was on and then I was notrecording often until 2:00 a.m. or 3:00
 a.m. I think I'm fortunate it doesn't doesn't show that it was recorded thatlate at night but it was really
 inspiring the the thought that we could create content to help so many peoplelearn about machine learning how does


Speaker 0 :that feel the fact that you're probably
 somewhat along maybe a couple of friends recording with a logitech webcam andkind of going home alone at 1:00 and
 2:00 a.m. at night and knowing that that's going to reach sort ofthousands of people eventually millions
 of people is what's that feeling like I mean is there a feeling of justsatisfaction of pushing through I think


Speaker 1 :is humbling and I wasn't thinking about
 what I was viewing I think one thing we I'm proud to say we caught right fromthe early days was I told my whole team
 back then that the number one priority is to do what's best for learnis toasbestos students and so when I went in
 a recording studio the only thing on my mind was what can I say how can I designmy slides ready to draw a right to make
 these concepts as clear as possible for lehre newsI think you know I've seen sometimes
 instructors is tempting hey let's talk about my work maybe if I teach you aboutmy research
 someone will cite my papers a couple more times and I think one things we gotright launch the first few MOOCs and
 later building Coursera was putting in place that bedrock principle let's justdo what's best for learners then forget
 about everything else and I think that that is a guiding principle turns out tobe really important to the to the rise
 of the movement and the kind of learner

Speaker 0 :your imagined in your mind is as as
 broad as possible as global as possible so really try to reach as many peopleinterested in machine learning and AI as


Speaker 1 :possible I really want to help anyone
 that had an interest in machine learning to break into fields and and I thinksometimes eventually people ask me hey
 why you spend so much time explaining gradient descent and then and my answerwas if I look at what I think to learn
 they need somewhat benefit from I felt that having that a good understanding ofthe foundations coming back to the
 basics would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career soyou've tried to consistently make
 decisions on that principle so one of

Speaker 0 :the things you actually revealed to the
 narrow AI community at the time and to the world is that the amount of peoplewho are actually interested in AI is
 much larger than we imagined by you teaching the class and how popularbecame it showed that wow this isn't
 just a small community of sort of people who go to Europe's andand it's much bigger it's the
 developers it's people from all over the world from front I mean I'm Russian soas everybody in Russia is really
 interested this is a huge number of programmers who are interested inmachine learning India China South
 America everywhere that there's just millions of people who are interestedmachine learning so how big you get a
 sense that this number of people is that are interested in your perspective I

Speaker 1 :think the numbers grown over time I
 think I'm one of those things that maybe it feels like it came out of nowherebut it's an insider building it it took
 years there's all those overnight successes that took years to get theremy first foray into this type of
 education was when we were filming my Stanford class and sticking the videoson YouTube and then some other things
 with uploading the holes and so on but you know basically the one hour fifteenminute video that we put on YouTube and
 then we had four or five other versions of websites that had built most of whatyou would never have heard of because
 they reach small audiences but that allowed me to iterate allow my team andme to innovate to learn what the ideas
 that work and what doesn't for example one of the features I was really excitedabout and really proud of was build this
 website where multiple people could be logged into the website at the same timeso today if you go to a website you know
 if you're logged in and then I want to log in you need to log out it was thesame browser the same computer but I
 thought well one of two people say you and me were watching a video together infront of the computer what if a website
 could have you type your name and password hit me type in their passwordand then now the computer knows both of
 us are watching together and it gives both of us credit for anything we do asa group influences feature rolled it out
 in a higher in school in San Francisco we had about 20-something users worththe teacher there Sacred Heart Cathedral
 prep teachers great and guess what zero people use the speaker it turns outpeople studying online they want to
 watch the videos by themselves so you can playback pause at your own speedrather than in groups so that was one
 example of a tiny lesson learned out of many that allows us to hone in to theset of features and it sounds like a


Speaker 0 :brilliant feature so I guess the lesson
 to take from that is you there's something that looks amazing onpaper and then nobody uses it doesn't
 actually have the in the impact that you think it might have and so yeah I sawthat you really went through a lot of
 different features and a lot of ideas you had to arrive at the final atCoursera its final kind of powerful
 thing that showed the world that MOOCs can educate millions and I think with

Speaker 1 :how um machine learning movements as
 well I think it didn't come out of nowhere instead what happened was asmore people learned about machine
 learning they will tell their friends and their friends will see how the bigworld to their work and then and in the
 community kept on growing um and I think we're still growing you know I don'tknow in the future what percentage of
 our developers would be AI developers I could easily see it being more for 50percent right because so many a I
 developers broadly construed not just people doing the machine learningmodeling but the people but the
 infrastructure data pipelines you know all the software's surrounding the oldmachine learning model maybe is even
 bigger I feel like today almost every softwareengineer has some understanding of the
 clouds no oh you know but maybe this is my microcontroller developer doesn'tneed to do the cloud but I feel like the
 vast majority of software in Jesus today are sort of having appreciated the cloudI think in the future maybe we'll
 approach nearly a hundred percent of all developers being you know in some way anAI developer or at least having an
 appreciation of machine learning and my

Speaker 0 :hope is that there's this kind of effect
 that there's people who are not really interested in soft being a programmer orbeing into software engineering like
 biologists chemists and physicists even mechanical engineers and all thesedisciplines that are now more and more
 sitting on large data sets and here they didn't think they're interested inprogramming until they have this data
 set and they realized there's the set of machine learning tools that allow you touse the data set so they actually become
 they learn to program and they become new programmer so like the not justbecause you've mentioned a larger
 percentage of developers become machine learning people the it seems like moreand more the the kinds of people who are
 becoming developers is also growing significantly

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah I think I think once upon a
 time only a small part of humanity was literate you could read and write andand and maybe you thought maybe not
 everyone needs to learn to read and write you know you just go listen to afew monks write me to you and maybe that
 was enough or maybe we just need a few handful of authors to write thebestsellers and then no one else needs
 to write but what we found was that by giving as many people you know in somecountries almost everyone basically
 literacy it dramatically enhanced human to human communications and we can nowwrite for an audience of one such as if
 I send you an email you send me an email I think in computing we're still in thatphase where so few people know how the
 codes that the code is mostly have to code for relatively large audiences butif everyone well most people became
 developers at some level similar to how most people and develop economies aresomewhat literate I would love to see
 the owners of a mom-and-pop store be with a very little code to customize theTV display for their special this week
 and I think of it enhance human to computer communications which isbecoming more more important today as


Speaker 0 :well so you think you think it's
 possible that machine learning becomes kind of similar to literacy where we'reyeah like you said the owners of a
 mom-and-pop shop is basically everybody in all walks of life would have somedegree of programming capability


Speaker 1 :I could see society getting there um
 there's one other interesting thing you know if I go talk to the mom and popstore if I toss a lot of people in their
 daily professions I previously didn't have a good story for why they shouldlearn to code yeah we give them some
 reasons but what I found with the rise of machine learning and data science isthat I think the number of people with a
 concrete use for data science in their daily lives and their jobs may be evenlarger than the number of people of a
 country used for software engineering for example if you were actually run asmall mom-and-pop store I think if you
 can analyze the data about your sales your customers I think there's actuallyreal value there maybe even more than
 traditional software engineer so I find that for a lot of my friendsin various professions being recruiters
 or accountants or you know people that work in the factories which I deal withmore and more these days I feel if they
 were data scientists at some level they could immediately use that in their workso I think that data science and machine
 learning may be an even easier entree into thedeveloper world for a lot of people then
 the software engineering that's

Speaker 0 :interesting and I grew that but that's a
 beautifully put we live in a world where most courses and talks have slidesPowerPoint keynote and yet you famously
 often still use a marker and a whiteboard the simplicity of that iscompelling in for me at least fun to
 watch so let me ask why do you like using a marker and whiteboard even on

Speaker 1 :the biggest of stages I think it depends
 on the concepts you want to explain for mathematical concepts it's nice to buildat the equation one piece at a time
 and the whiteboard marker or the pen is stylus is a very easy way you know tobuild up the equation a build up a
 complex concept one piece at a time while you're talking about it andsometimes that enhances
 understandability the downside of writing is as it slow and so if you wanta long sentence it's very hard to write
 that so I think their pros and cons in sometimes I use slides and sometimesthey use a whiteboard or a stylus the


Speaker 0 :slowness of a whiteboard is also it's
 upside is it forces you to reduce everything to the basics some of some ofyour talks and involve the whiteboard I
 mean there's really none but you go very slowly and you really focus on the mostsimple principles and that's a beautiful
 that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas that I think is surprisingly leastfor me is is great for education like a
 great talk I think is not one that has a lot of content a great talk is one thatjust clearly says a few simple ideas and
 I think you the white board somehow enforces that Peter erbil who's now oneof the top roboticists and reinforcement
 learning experts in the world was your first PhDstudent hey so I bring him up just
 because I kind of imagine this is this was must have been an interesting timein your life do you have any favorite
 memories of working with Peter your first student in those uncertain timesespecially before deep learning really
 really sort of blew up any favorite memories from those times you know I was

Speaker 1 :really fortunate to have had Peter of
 you as my first PhD students and I think even my long-term professional successbuilds on early foundations or early
 work that that Peter was so critical to so I was really grateful to him forworking at me you know what
 not a lot of people know is just how hard research was and and so is Peter'sPhD thesis was using reinforcement
 learning to fly helicopters and so you know actually even today the websiteHelly thought stanford.edu heö I don't
 Stanford are you still up here watch videos of us using reinforcementlearning to make the helicopter fly
 upside down five loops rolls this is

Speaker 0 :cool so one of the most incredible


Speaker 1 :robotics videos ever so how do you still
 watch it oh yeah

Speaker 0 :thanks firing that's from like 2000 it's
 eight or seven or six like that really

Speaker 1 :my dad's like yeah so is over ten years


Speaker 0 :old that was really inspiring to a lot


Speaker 1 :of people yeah but not many people see
 is how hard it was so Peter and Adam codes and Morgan Quigley and I work onvarious versions of the helicopter and a
 lot of things did not work for example turns out one of the hardest problems wehad was when the helicopters flying
 around upside down doing stunts how do you figure out the position how do youlocalize a helicopter so we want to try
 all sorts of things having one GPS unit doesn't work because you're flyingupside down the GPS units facing down so
 you can't see the satellites so we tried them we experimented trying to have twoGPS units one facing up one facing the
 house if you flip over that didn't work because the downward facing one couldn'tsynchronize if you're flipping quickly
 um Morgan quickly was exploring this crazy complicated configuration ofspecialized hardware to interpret GPS
 signal look into FPGA is completely insanespent about a year working on that
 didn't work so I remember Peter great guy him and me you know sitting down inmy office looking at saw the latest
 things we had tried that didn't work and saying you know Don it like what nowbecause because we tried so many things
 in it and it just didn't work in the end what we did when Adam Cole's was wascrucial to this was put cameras on the
 ground and used cameras on the ground to localize a helicopter and that soft alocalization problem so that we couldn't
 focus on the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learningtechniques so didn't actually mean to
 helicopter fly and you know I'm reminded when when was doing um this work atStanford around that time there was a
 lot of reinforcement learning theoretical papers but not a lot ofpractical applications so the autonomous
 helicopter work for fine helicopters was this one of the few you know practicalapplications of reinforcer learning at
 the time which which caused it to become pretty well known I I feel like we mighthave almost come full circle with today
 there's so much but so much hype so much excitement yeah about reinforcementlearning but again we're hunting for
 more applications and all of these great ideas that delica he's come up with what

Speaker 0 :was the drive sort of in the face of the
 fact that most people doing theoretical work what motivate you in theuncertainty and the challenges to get
 the helicopter sort of to do the the applied work to get the actual system towork yeah in the face of fear
 uncertainty is sort of the setbacks the you mentioned for localization I like

Speaker 1 :stuff that works


Speaker 0 :III know physical world so like it's
 this back to the shredder and you know

Speaker 1 :III like theory but when I work on
 theory myself and this personal taste I'm not seeing anyone else should dowhat I do but when I work on theory I
 Percy enjoyed more if I feel that my the work I do will influence people havepositive impact will help someone
 I remember when many years ago our speaking with a mathematics professorand it kind of just said hey ytt what
 you do and then he said he you know he had stars in his eyes when he answeredand this mathematician not from Stanford
 different University he said I do what I dobecause it helps me to discover truth
 and beauty in the universe here starts analyzing he said yeah and I thoughtthat's great
 um I don't want to do that I think it's great that someone does that fullysupportive people that do a lot of
 respect review that but I am more motivated when I can see a line to howthe work that my team's and I are doing
 house people the world needs all sorts of people I'm just one type hopingeveryone should do things the same way
 as I do but when I delve into either theory or practice if I personally haveconviction you know that here's a
 pathway to help people I find that more satisfying to have that conviction that

Speaker 0 :that's your path you were a proponent of
 deep learning before it gained widespread acceptance what did you seein this field that gave you confidence
 what was your thinking process like in that first decade of the I don't knowthat's called 2000s the odds yeah I can


Speaker 1 :tell you the thing we got wrong with the
 thing we got right the thing we really got wrong was the importance of theearly importance of unsupervised
 learning so early days of Google brain we put a lot of effort into unsupervisedlearning rather than supervised learning
 and those as argument I think was around them 2005 after a new Europe's at thattime called nips but now in Europe said
 ended and Geoff Hinton and I were sitting in the cafeteria outside youknow the conference we had lunch was
 chatting and Geoff pulled up this napkin he started sketching this argument onher on a napkin
 it was very compelling as our repeated human brain has about a hundred trillionso there's 10 to the 14 synaptic
 connections you will live about 10 10 and 9 seconds that's 30 years youactually live for two to two by ten to
 nine maybe three right nine seconds so just let's say ten tonine so if each synaptic connection each
 weight in your brains new network has just a one bit parameter that's 10 tothe 14 bits you need to learn in up to
 10 to 9 seconds of your life so via the simple argument which is a lot ofproblems it's very simplified that's 10
 to the 5 bits per second you need to learn in your life and I have aone-year-old daughter I am NOT pointing
 out 10 to 5 bits per second of labels to her so and and I think I'm a very lovingparent but I'm just not gonna do that
 so from this you know very crude definitely problematic argument there'sjust no way that most of what we know is
 through supervised learning the wife you get so many visit information is fromsucking in images audio those
 experiences in the world and so that arguments and a lot of known forcesargument you go going to really convince
 me that there's a lot of power to unsupervised learning so that was thepart that we actually maybe maybe gone
 wrong I still think I was learning is really important but we but but in theearly days you know 10 15 years ago and
 all of us thought that was the path

Speaker 0 :forward oh so you're saying that that
 that perhaps was the wrong intuition for

Speaker 1 :the time for the time that that was the
 part we got wrong the part we got right was the importance of scale so Adamcalls another wonderful person fortunate
 said worth of him he was in my group of Stanford at the time and Adam had runthese experiments at Stanford showing
 that the bigger we train a learning algorithm the better performance and itwas based on that it was a graph that
 hadn't generated you know where the x-axis y-axis lines going up into theright so bigger paint make this thing
 the better his performance accuracy is the vertical axis so it's really basedon that chart that Adam generated that
 he gave me the conviction that you could scale these models way bigger than whatwe could on the few CPUs we should
 understand that then we could get even better results and it was really basedon that one figure that Adam generated
 that gave me the conviction to go of Sebastian'sto pitch you know starting starting a
 project at Google which became the CooCoo brain crunch brain you know

Speaker 0 :filing Google brain and there the
 intuition was scale will bring performance for the system so we shouldchase
 larger and larger scale and I think people don't don't realize how howgroundbreaking of it is simple but it's
 a groundbreaking idea that bigger data sets will result in better performance

Speaker 1 :it was cultural first it was
 controversial at the time some of my well-meaning friends you know see anypeople in the machine or in community I
 won't name but whose people told people of some some of whom we know mywell-meaning friends came and we're
 trying to give me friendly meze hey Andrew why are you doing this is crazyit's in the near enough architecture
 look at these architectures of building you just like go for scale like there'sa bad career move so so my well-meaning
 friends you know we're trying to some of them we're trying to talk me out of itif I find it if you want to make a
 breakthrough you sometimes have to have conviction and do something before it'spopular since that lets you have a


Speaker 0 :bigger impact let me ask you just a
 small tangent on that topic I find myself arguing with people saying thatgreater scale especially in the context
 of active learning so it's very carefully selecting the data set butgrowing the scale of the data set is
 going to lead to even further breakthroughs in deep learning andthere's currently pushback at that idea
 that larger datasets are no longer that so you want to increase the efficiencyof learning you want to make better
 learning mechanisms and I personally believe that bigger data sets will stillwith the same learning methods we have
 now result in better performance what's your intuition at this time on those IAnna this dual side is do we need to
 come up with better architectures for learning or can we just get biggerbetter data sets that will improve


Speaker 1 :performance I think both are important
 and there's also problem dependent so for a few data sets we may beapproaching your Bayes error rate of
 approaching or surpassing human level performance and then there's thattheoretical ceiling that we will
 a surface of a CRE but then I think there plenty of problems where we'rewe're still quite far from either human
 of a performance all from Bayes error rate and bigger data says with newnetworks but without further elaborate
 innovation will be sufficient to take us further but on the flip side if we lookat the recent breakthroughs using you
 know transforming networks for language models it was a combination of novelarchitecture but also scale has a lot to
 do with it if we look at what happened with your GP - and birdsI think scale was a large part of the


Speaker 0 :story yeah that's that's not often
 talked about is the scale of the data set it was trained on and the quality ofthe data set because there's some so it
 was like reddit threads that had they were operated highly so there's alreadysome weak supervision on a very large
 data set that people don't often talk about right

Speaker 1 :I find it today we have maturing
 processes to managing cold things like get right version control it took us along time to evolve the good processes I
 remember when my friends and I were emailing each other C++ files in emailyou know but then we had was that CVS
 subversion get maybe something else in the future we're very immature in termsof Susa managing data and think about
 how the creator and how the soft I'm very hot messy data problems I thinkthere's a lot of innovation there to be
 I still I love the idea that you were

Speaker 0 :versioning through email I'll give you


Speaker 1 :one example um when we work with
 manufacturing companies is not at all uncommon for there to be multiple latelists that disagree of each other right
 and so we were doing the work in visual inspection we will you know take say aplastic cards and show to one inspector
 and the inspector sometimes very opinionated there go clearly that's thedefector scratch understand so gonna
 check this part take the same parts of different inspector different veryopinionated clearly the scratch is small
 is fine don't throw it away you're gonna make usyours and then sometimes you take the
 same plastic part show it to the same inspector in the afternoon and I supposein the morning
 and very affinity go in the morning to say clearly is okay in the afternoonequally confident clearly this is a
 defect and so what does the i-team supposed to do if if sometimes even oneperson doesn't agree of himself or
 herself in the span of a day so I think these are the types of um very practicalvery messy data problems that that you
 know that my teams wrestle with in the case of large consumer Internetcompanies where you have a billion users
 you have a lot of data you don't worry about they just take the average it kindof works but in a case of other industry
 settings we don't have big data if just a small data very small the users maybe100 defective parts or 100 examples of a
 defect if you have only 100 examples these little labeling errors you know if10 of your hundred labels aren't wrong
 that actually is 10% it is that has a big impact so how do you clean this upwhat you're supposed to do this is an
 example of the of the types of things that my team's did this is a landing AIexample are wrestling with to deal with
 small data which comes up all the time once you're outside consumer internet

Speaker 0 :yeah that's fascinating so then you
 invest more effort in time in thinking about the actual labeling process whatare the labels what are the how our
 disagreements resolved in all those kinds of like pragmatic real worldproblems that's a fascinating space yeah


Speaker 1 :I find it actually when I'm teaching at
 Stanford I increasingly encourage students at Stanford to try to findtheir own project
 for the end of term project rather than just downloading someone else's nicelyclean data set it's actually much harder
 if you need to go and define your own problem and find your own dataset ratherthan you go to one of the several good
 websites very good websites with with creams scopesdatasets that you could just work on


Speaker 0 :you're now running three efforts the AI
 fund landing AI and deep learning AI as you've said the AI fund is involved increating new companies from scratch
 Landing AI is involved in helping already established companies do AI anddeep learning AI is for education of
 everyone else or of individuals interested of getting into the field andexcelling in
 so let's perhaps talk about each of these areas first deep learning that AIhow the basic question how does a person
 interested in deep learning get started

Speaker 1 :in the field the Atlanta AI is working
 to create courses to help people break into AI so my machine learning coursethat I taught through Stanford is one of
 the most popular causes on Coursera to

Speaker 0 :this day it's probably one of the
 courses sort of if I ask somebody how did you get into machine learning or howdid you fall in love with machine
 learning or will get you interested they it always goes back to rain and Drang atsome point you won't find the amount of
 people you influence is ridiculous so for that I'm sure I speak for a lot ofpeople say big thank you no yeah thank


Speaker 1 :you you know I was once reading a news
 article I think it was tech review and I'm gonna mess up the statistic but Iremember reading article that said um
 something like one-third of all programmers are self-taught I may havethe number one third Romney was
 two-thirds but I rent an article I thought this doesn't make senseeveryone is self-taught because you
 teach yourself I don't teach people and

Speaker 0 :it's no good haha oh yeah so how does
 one get started in deep learning and where does deep learning that AI fitinto that


Speaker 1 :so the define specialization offered by
 today is is this I think one it was called service specialization it mightstill be so it's very popular way for
 people to take that specialization to learn about everything from new networksto how to tune in your network so what
 is it confident to what is a RNA nor sequence model or what is an attentionmodel and so the design specialization
 um steps everyone's through those algorithms so you deeply understand itand can implement it and use it you know
 for whatever a from the very beginning

Speaker 0 :so what would you say the prerequisites
 for somebody to take the deep learning specialization in terms of maybe math orprogramming background you know need to


Speaker 1 :understand basic programming since there
 are Pro exercises in Python and the map prereq is quite basicso no calculus is needed if you know
 calculus is great you get better intuitions but deliberately try to teachthat specialization without requirement
 calculus so I think high school math would be sufficient if you know how toMouse by two matrices I think I think
 that that deaths that desperates

Speaker 0 :so little basically in your algebra it's


Speaker 1 :great
 basically the algebra even very very basically the algebra and someprogramming I think that people that
 done the machine learning also find a deep learning specialization a biteasier but is also possible to jump into
 the divine specialization directly but it'll be a little bit harder since wetend to you know go over faster concepts
 like how does gradient descent work and what is an objective function whichwhich is covered mostly in the machine
 learning course could you briefly

Speaker 0 :mention some of the key concepts in deep
 learning that students should learn that you envision them learning in the firstfew months in the first year or so so if


Speaker 1 :you take the d-line specialization you
 learned foundations of what is in your network how do you build up in yournetwork from a you know single which is
 a unit stack of layers to different activation functions you don't have atrained in your networks one thing I'm
 very proud of in that specialization as we go through a lot of practicalknow-how of how to actually make these
 things work so what the differences between different optimizationalgorithms so what do you do of the
 algorithm over things so how do you tell the algorithm is overfitting when youcollect more data when should you not
 bother to collect more data I find that um even today unfortunatelythere are your engineers that will spend
 six months trying to pursue a particular direction such as collect more databecause we heard more data is valuable
 but sometimes you could run some tests and could have figured out six monthsearlier therefore this problem
 collecting more data isn't going to cut it so just don't spend secondscollecting more data spend your time
 modifying the architecture or trying something also go through a lot of thepractical know-how also that when when
 when when someone will you take the deviant specialization you have thoseskills to be very efficient in how you
 build is net

Speaker 0 :so dive right in to play with the
 network to train it to do the inference on a particular data set to build anintuition about it without without
 building it up too big to where you spend like you said six months learningbuilding up your big project without
 building an intuition of a small small aspect of the data that could alreadytell you everything needs you know about


Speaker 1 :that date yes and also the systematic
 frameworks of thinking for how to go about building practical machinelearning maybe to make an analogy um
 when we learn to code we have to learn the syntax of some Korean language rightbe a Python or C++ or octave or whatever
 but that equally important that may be even more important part of coding is tounderstand how to string together these
 lines of code into coherent things so you know when should you put somethingin the function call and when should you
 not know how do you think about abstraction so those frameworks are whatmakes the programmer efficient even more
 than understanding to syntax I remember when I was an undergrad at CarnegieMellon um one of my friends with debug
 their codes by first trying to compile it and then it was T plus s code andthen every line did a syntax error they
 want to care for the syntax errors as quickly as possible so how do you dothat well they would delete every single
 line of code with a syntax error so really efficient for general syntaxerrors were horrible service I
 think so we learned how the debug and I think in machine learning the way youdebug the machine learning program is
 very different than the way you you know like do binary search or whatever usethe debugger I traced through the code
 in in traditional software engineering so isn't evolving discipline but I findthat the people that are really good at
 debugging machine learning algorithms are easily 10xmaybe 100x faster at getting something


Speaker 0 :to work so and the basic process of
 debugging is so the the bug in this case why is in this thing learning learningimproving sort of going into the
 questions of overfitting and all those kinds of things that's that's thelogical space that the debugging is
 happening in would in your network

Speaker 1 :yeah the often question is why doesn't
 it work yet well can I expect it eventually work and what are the thingsI could try
 change the architecture malteaser more regularization different optimizationalgorithm you know the different types
 of data are so to answer those questions systematically so that you don't headingdown so you don't spend six months
 hitting down the blind alley before someone comes and says why you spent sixmonths doing this what concepts and deep


Speaker 0 :learning do you think students struggle
 the most with or sort of this is the biggest challenge for them was to getover that hill
 it's it hooks them and it inspires them

Speaker 1 :and they really get it similar to
 learning mathematics I think one of the challenges of deep learning is thatthere are lot of concepts that build on
 top of each other if you ask me what's hard about mathematics I have a hardtime pinpointing one thing is it
 addition subtraction is it carry is it multiplication long there's lot of stuffI think one of the challenges of
 learning math and of learning certain technical fields is that a lot ofconcepts and you miss a concept then
 you're kind of missing the prerequisite for something that comes later so in thedeep learning specialization try to
 break down the concepts to maximize the answer each component beingunderstandable so when you move on to
 the more advanced thing we learn your confidence hopefully you have enoughintuitions from the earlier sections to
 then understand why we structure confidence in a certain certain way andthen eventually why we build you know
 our nn zone ellos tienen or attention model in a certain way a building on topof the earlier concepts I'm curious you
 you you do a lot of teaching as well do you have a do you have a favorite thisis the hard concept moment in your
 teaching

Speaker 0 :well I don't think anyone's ever turned


Speaker 1 :the interview on me I think that's a


Speaker 0 :really good question yeah it's it's it's
 really hard to capture the moment when they struggle I think you put a reallyeloquently I do think there's moments
 that are like aha moments that really inspire people I think for some reasonreinforcement learning especially deep
 reinforcement learning is a really great way to really inspire people and getwhat the use of neural networks can do
 even though you know networks really are just a part of the deep RL framework butit's a really nice way to the to paint
 the entirety of the picture of a neural network being able to learn from scratchknowing nothing and explore the world
 and pick up lessons I find that a lot of the aha moments happen when you use deepRL to teach people about neural networks
 which is counterintuitive I find like a lot of the inspired sort of fire andpeople's passion people's eyes comes
 from the RL world do you find I mean first of all learning and to be a usefulpart of the teaching process or not I


Speaker 1 :still teach me forceful learning and one
 of my Stanford classes and my PhD thesis wonderful so nice thank you I find it ifI'm trying to teach students the most
 useful techniques for them to use today I end up shrinking the amount of timeand talk about reinforce another in
 English it's not what's working today now our world changes so fast maybe itdoes be totally different in a couple
 years I think we need a couple more things for reinforcement learning to getthere if you get there yeah one of my
 teams is looking to reinforce the learning for some robotic control tossso I see the applications but if you
 look at it as a percentage of all of the impact of you know the types of thingswe do is at least today outside of you
 know playing video games right in a few of the games the the scope nearest abunch of us was standing around saying
 hey what's your best example of an actual deploy reinforcement learningapplication and you know among your like
 scene in machine learning researchers right and again there are some emergingones but
 there are there are not that many great examples well I think you're absolutely

Speaker 0 :right the sad thing is there hasn't been
 a big application impactful real-world application reinforcement learning Ithink its biggest impact to me has been
 in the toy domain in the game domain in a small example that's what I mean foreducational purpose it seems to be a fun
 thing to explore new networks with but I think from your perspective and I thinkthat might be the best perspective is if
 you're trying to educate with a simple example in order to illustrate how thiscan actually be grown to scale and have
 a real world impact then perhaps focusing on the fundamentals ofsupervised learning in the context of
 you know a simple data set even like an eminence data set is the right way isthe right path to take I just the amount
 of fun I've seen people have of the reinforcement learning it's been greatbut not in the applied impact on the
 real-world setting so it's a it's a trade-off how much impact you want tohave versus how much fun you want to


Speaker 1 :have yeah that's really cool and I feel
 like you know the world actually needs alsoeven within machine learning I feel like
 deep learning is so exciting but the AI team shouldn't just use deep learningI find that my team's use a portfolio of
 tools and maybe that's not the exciting thing to say but some days we useinternet some days we use a you know the
 PC a the other day are sitting down with my team looking at PC residuals tryingto figure out what's going on with PC
 applied to manufacturing problem and sometimes we use the promising graphicalmodel sometimes you use a knowledge
 trough where some of the things that has tremendous industry impact but theamount of chat about knowledge drops in
 academia has really thin compared to the actual rower impact so so I thinkreinforcement learning should be in that
 portfolio and then it's about balancing how much we teach all of these thingsand the world the world should have
 diverse skills if he said if you know everyone just learn one one narrow thing

Speaker 0 :yeah the diverse skill help you discover
 the right tool for the job what is the most beautiful surprising or inspiringidea in deep learning to you something
 that captivated your imagination at the scale that could be a theperformance I give you achieve of scale


Speaker 1 :or there are other ideas I think that if
 my only job was being an academic researcher and have an unlimited budgetand you know didn't have to worry about
 short-term impact and only focus on long term in fact I pretty spent all my timedoing research on unsupervised learning
 I still think unsupervised learning is a beautiful idea at both this Pastnerherbs and I CML I was attending
 workshops on the center Vera's talks about self supervised learning which isone vertical segment maybe of sort of
 unsupervised learning I'm excited about maybe just to summarize the idea I guessyou know the idea of describe movie no
 please so here's the examples self supervised learning let's say we grab alot of unlabeled images off the internet
 so with infinite amounts of this type of data I'm going to take each image androtate it by a random multiple of 90
 degrees and then I'm going to train a supervised near Network to predict whatwas the original orientation so has
 something rotated 90 degrees hundred eighty degrees turns in seven degrees orzero degrees so you can generate an
 infinite amount of label data because you rotate to the image so you knowwhat's the branch of label and so
 various researchers have found that by taking unlabeled data and making uplabel datasets and training a large
 neural network on these thoughts you can then take the hidden layerrepresentation and transfer to a
 different toss very powerfully um learning word embeddings when we take asentence to leave the word predict the
 missing word which is how we learn you know one of the ways we learn where theembeddings is another example and I
 think there's now this portfolio of techniques for generating these made-uptoss another one called jigsaw what
 behave you take an image cut it up into a you know three by three grid so like anine 3x3 puzzle piece jump out the nine
 pieces and have a neural network predict which of the nine factorial possiblepermutations it came from so are many
 groups including your opening I Peter P has been doing some work on this toFacebook
 Google brain I think deep mind Oh Aaron menthols has great work on the CPCobjective so many teams are doing
 exciting work and I think this is a way to generate infinitely both data and andI find this a very exciting piece of an


Speaker 0 :supervisor and he's a long-term you
 think that's going to unlock a lot of power and in machine learning systems isthis kind of unsupervised learning I


Speaker 1 :don't think there's the whole enchilada
 I think that's just a piece of it and I think this one piece unsuited is selfsupervised learning it's starting to get
 traction we're very close to it being useful well what embedding is reallyreally useful I think we're getting
 closer and closer to just having a significant real world impact maybe incomputer vision and video but I think
 this concept and then I think there'll be other concepts around it you knowother unsupervised learning things that
 I worked on I've been excited about I was really excited about sparse codingand I see a slow feature analysis I
 think all of these are ideas that various of us were working on about adecade ago before we all got distracted
 by how well supervised learning was wearing work yeah it was a we would

Speaker 0 :return we were returned to the
 fundamentals of representation learning that that really started this movement

Speaker 1 :of deep learning I think there's a lot
 more work that one could explore around the steam of ideas and other ideas tocome or better algorithms so if we could


Speaker 0 :return to maybe talk quickly about the
 specifics of deep learning that AI the deep learning specialization perhaps howlong does it take to complete the course


Speaker 1 :would you say the official length of the
 divine specialization is I think 16 weeks so about 4 months but is go atyour own pace so if you subscribe to the
 divine socialization there are people that finish that in less than a month byworking more intensely and study more
 intensely so it really depends on on the individual who created the divinespecialization we wanted to make it very
 accessible and very affordable and with you know Coursera and Devon dyerseducation mission one thing that's
 really important to me is that if there's someone for whom paying anythingis a it's a financial hardship then just
 apply for financial and get it for free if you were to

Speaker 0 :recommend a daily schedule for people in
 learning whether it's through the deep learning that a a specialization or justlearning in the world of deep learning
 what would you recommend how do they go about day two days or a specific adviceabout learning about their journey in
 the world of deep learning machine

Speaker 1 :learning I think I'm getting the habit
 of learning is key and that means regularity so for example we send outour weekly newsletter the batch every
 Wednesday so people know is coming Wednesday you can spend a little bit oftime on Wednesday catching up on the
 latest news through the batch on the on on on Wednesday and for myself I'vepicked up a habit of spending some time
 every Saturday and every Sunday reading or studying and so I don't wake up onthe Saturday and have to make a decision
 do I feel like reading or studying today or not it's just it's just what I do andthe fact is a habit makes it easier so I
 think if someone can get in that habit it's like you know just like we brushour teeth every morning I don't think
 about it if I thought about this a little bit annoying to have to spend twominutes doing that but it's a habit that
 it takes no cognitive loads but this would be so much harder if we have tomake a decision every morning so and
 actually that's the reason why we're the same thing every day as well it's justone less decision I just get out in
 there where I'm sure so I think you can get that habit that consistency ofstudying then then it actually feels


Speaker 0 :easier so yeah it's kind of amazing in
 my own life like I play guitar every day for life forced myself to at least forfive minutes play guitar it's just it's
 a ridiculously short period of time but because I've gotten into that habit it'sincredible what you can accomplish in a
 period of a year or two years you could become you knowexceptionally good at certain aspects of
 a thing by just doing it every day for a very short period of time it's kind of amiracle that that is how it works
 it's adds up over time yeah and I think

Speaker 1 :is this something is often not about the
 bursts of sustained effort and all-night is because you can only do that in alimited
 of times it's the sustained effort over a long time I think you know reading tworesearch papers there's a nice thing to
 do but the power is not reading through research papers this reading throughresearch papers a week for a year then
 you've read a hundred papers and and you actually learn a lot when you read a

Speaker 0 :hundred papers so regularity and making
 learning a habit do you have do you have general other study tips forparticularly deep learning that people
 should in in their process of learning is there some kind of recommendations ortips you have as they learn one thing I


Speaker 1 :still do when I'm trying to study
 something really deeply is take handwritten notes in theories I knowthere are a lot of people that take the
 deep learning courses during the commutes or something where maybe mobilequit to take notes so I know it's may
 not work for everyone but when I'm taking courses on Coursera you know andthat still takes on my every now and
 then the most recent I took was a was a course on clinical trials because thoseengines of all that I got my little
 moleskin notebook and I was sitting in my desk is just taking down notes sowhat the instructor was saying and that
 Act we know that that act of taking notes preferably handwritten notesincreases retention so as you're sort of


Speaker 0 :watching the video just kind of pausing
 maybe and then taking the basic insights

Speaker 1 :down on paper yeah so I should have been
 a few studies if you know search online you find for some of these studies thattaking handwritten notes because
 handwriting is slower as were saying just now um it causes you to recoat theknowledge in your own words more and
 that process of recoding promotes long-term attention this is as opposedto typing which is fine again typing is
 better than nothing or in taking across and nautical isbetter than nothing any cause law but
 comparing handwritten notes and typing um you can usually type faster for a lotof people do you can hand write notes
 and so when people type they're more likely to transcribe verbatim what theyheard and that reduces the amount of
 recoding and that actually results in less long-term retention I don't know

Speaker 0 :what the psychological effect there is
 but so true there's something fundamentally different aboutin handwriting I wonder what that is I
 wonder if it is as simple as just the time it takes to write it slower

Speaker 1 :yeah and and and because because you
 can't write as many words you have to take whatever they said and summarize itinto fewer words and that summarization
 process requires deeper processing of the meaning which then results in better

Speaker 0 :attention that's fascinating oh and then


Speaker 1 :I spent I think yeah because of course
 error I spent so much time studying pedagogy thank you my passion that Ireally love learning how to more
 efficiently help others learn yeah one of the things I do both in creatingvideos or when we write the batch is um
 I kind of think is one minute spent of us going to be a more efficient learningexperience than one minute spent
 anywhere else and we really try to you know make a time efficient for thelearning it's good to know everyone's
 busy so when when we're editing them I often tell my teams everywhere it needsto fight for his life and if can delete
 it where this is the lead to that not wait that's not waste than during this

Speaker 0 :time wow that's so it's so amazing that
 you think that way because there is millions of people that are impacted byyour teaching and sort of that one
 minute spent has a ripple effect right three years of time which is justfascinating talk about how does one make
 a career out of an interest in deep learning give advice for people we justtalked about sort of the beginning early
 steps but if you want to make it a entire life's journey or at least ajourney of a decade or two how did it


Speaker 1 :how do you do it so most important thing
 is to get started right and ever I think in the early part of a career courseworkum like the divine specialization or
 it's a very efficient way to master this material so because you know instructorsbe me or someone else or you know
 Laurence Moroney teaches our tensor field specialization and other thingswe're working on spend effort to try to
 make a time efficient for you to learn new concepts of coursework becauseactually a very efficient way for people
 that learn concepts and the beginning parts of break into new fields in factone thing I see at Stanford
 some of my PhD students want to jump in the research right away and actuallytend to say look when you first copy
 yours the piece didn't spend time ticking causes because it lays thefoundation it's fine if you're less
 productive in your first couple of years you'd be better off in the long termum beyond a certain point there's
 materials that doesn't exist in courses because it's too cutting edge thecourses we created yeah there's some
 practical experience that we're not yet that good as teaching in a in a courseand I think after exhausting the
 efficient course were then most people need to go on to either ideally work onprojects and then maybe also continue
 their learning by reading blog polls and research papers and thing like thatdoing practice is really important and
 again I think is important to start small it's just do something today youread about deep learning if you like all
 these people doing such exciting things whatever I'm not building a neuralnetwork they change the world and what's
 the point well the point is sometimes building that time in your network youknow be it m-miss or upgrade to a
 fashion amnesty whatever it's doing your own fun hobby project that's how yougain the skills to let you do bigger and
 bigger projects I find this to be true at the individual level and also at theorganizational level for company to
 become good at machine learning sometimes the right thing to do is notto tackle the giant project is instead
 to do the small project that lets the organization learn and then build upfrom there
 but this triple for individuals and and and for and for companies just taking

Speaker 0 :the first step and then taking small
 steps it's the key should students pursue a PhD do you think you can do somuch that's the one of the fascinating
 things in machine learning you can have so much impact without ever getting aPhD so what are your thoughts should
 people go to grad school should people get a PhD I think that there are

Speaker 1 :multiple good options of which doing a
 PhD could be one of them I think that if someone's admitted to top ph.d programyou know that MIT Stanford top schools I
 think that's a very good experience or someone gets a job at a top organizationat the top a I team I think that's also
 good experience there are some things you still need a PhD to do if someone'saspiration is to be a professor here at
 the top academic University you just need a PhD to do that but if it goes toyou know start a complete build a
 complete do great technical work I think PhD is a good experience but I wouldlook at the different options available
 to someone you know where the places where you can get a job where the placeisn't getting a PhD program and kind of
 weigh the pros and cons of those so just

Speaker 0 :to linger on that for a little bit
 longer what final dreams and goals do you think people should have so the whatoptions for they explore so you can work
 in industry so for a large company like Google Facebook buy do all these largecompanies already have huge teams of
 machine learning engineers you can also do with an industry sort of moreresearch groups that kind of like Google
 research Google brain that you can also do like we say the professor neck as inacademia and what else oh you can still
 build your own company you can do a start-up is there anything that standsout between those options or are they
 all beautiful different journeys that

Speaker 1 :people should consider I think the thing
 that affects your experience more is less are you in discomfort versus thatcompany your academia versus industry I
 think the thing that affects to experience Moses who are the peopleyou're interacting with you know in the
 daily basis so even if you look at some of the large companies the experience ofindividuals and different teams is very
 different and what matters most is not the logo above the door when you walkinto the giant building every day what
 matters the most is who are the 10 people who are the 30 people youinteract with every day
 so I actually tend to advise people if you get a job from from a company alsowho is your manager who are your peers
 who are you actually going to talk to you we're all social creatures we tendto you know become more like the people
 around us and if you're working with great people you will learn faster or ifyou get admitted if you get a job at a
 great company or a great university maybe the logo you walk in you know isgreat but you're actually stuck on some
 team doing really worth it doesn't excite you and then that's actuallyreally bad experience so this is true
 both universities and for large companies forsmall companies you can kind of figure
 out who you be working quite quickly and I tend to advise people if a companyrefuses to tell you who you work with
 someone say oh join us the rotation system will figure out I think that thatthat's a worrying answer because it
 because it means you may not get sense - you mean not actually get to team withwith great peers and great people to
 work with it's actually a really

Speaker 0 :profound advice that we kind of
 sometimes sweep we don't consider to rigorously or carefully the peoplearound you are really often this
 especially when you accomplish great thingsit seems the great things are
 accomplished because of the people around you so that that's a it's notabout the the worry whether you learn
 this thing or that thing or like you said the logo that's hangs up top it'sthe people that's a fascinating and it's
 such a hard search process of finding

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :just like finding the right friends and
 somebody to get married with and that kind of thing it's a very hard searchprocess a people search problem yeah but


Speaker 1 :I think when someone interviews you know
 at a university or the research lab at a large corporation it's good to insist onjust asking who are the people who is my
 manager and if you refuse to tell me I'm gonna think well maybe that's becauseyou don't have a good answer it may not
 be someone I like

Speaker 0 :and if you don't particularly connect if
 something feels off for the people then don't stick to it you know that's areally important signal to consider yeah


Speaker 1 :and that's yeah I am in my standard
 cause cs2 30s was an ACN talk I think I gave like a hour long talk on careeradvice including on the job search
 process and then some of these those are yours if you can find those videos onalso and others I'll point people to


Speaker 0 :them beautiful so the AI fund helps ai
 startups get off the ground or perhaps you can elaborate all the fun thingsit's evolved with what's your advice and
 how does one build a successful hey I

Speaker 1 :start up you know in second Valley a lot
 of starter failures come from building our products that no one wantedso when you know cool technology but
 who's gonna use it so I think I tend to be very outcome driven um and thencustomer obsess ultimately we don't get
 to vote if we succeed or fail is only the customer that the only one that getsa thumbs up or thumbs down those in the
 long term in the short term you know there are various people who get variousvotes but in the long term that's what


Speaker 0 :really matters so as you build to start
 where to cast as the question well the customer gives a thought and give a

Speaker 1 :thumbs up on this I think so I think
 startups that are very customer focused customer says deeply understand thecustomer and are oriented to serve the
 customer are more likely to succeed with the provision that I think all ofus should only do things that we think
 create social good and lose the world for words I'm sorry I personally don'twant to build addictive digital products
 just so long as you know the things that that could be lucrative but I won't dobut if we can find ways to serve people
 in meaningful ways I think those can be those can be great things to do eitherthe academic setting or in a corporate
 setting real startup setting so can you

Speaker 0 :give me the idea of why you started the


Speaker 1 :AI fund I remember when I was leaving
 the AI group at Baidu I had two jobs two parts of my job one was to build an AIengine to support the existing
 businesses and that wasn't running you know just read this performed by itselfthe second part of my job at the time
 which was to try to systematically initiate new lines of businesses usingthe company's aiq abilities so you know
 the self-driving car team came out my group the spot speaker teamsimilar to what is some amazonica a
 lexer in the US but we announced it before Amazon did so we were goodbye towasn't following him wasn't following an
 Amazon that that came out of my group and I found that to be um actually thatthe most fun part of my job so what I
 what to do was to build AI fund as a startup studio to systematically createnew startup firms
 with all the things we can now do of AI I think the ability to build new teamsto go after this rich space of
 opportunities is a very important way to very important mechanism to get theseprojects done that I think will move the
 world forward so of unfortunate that don't the few teams that had ameaningful positive impact and I felt
 that we might present do this in the most systematic repeatable way so astart-up studio is a relatively new
 concept there there are maybe dozens of startup studios you're right now but Ifeel like all of us many teams are still
 trying to figure out how do you systematically build companies with ahigh success rate so I think even though
 my you know venture capital friends are seem to be more and more buildingcompanies rather than investing
 companies but I find a fascinating thing to do to figure out the mechanisms bywhich we could systematically build
 successful teams successful businesses in in areas that we find meaningful so

Speaker 0 :startup studio is something is is a
 place and a mechanism for startups to go from zero to success so try to develop a

Speaker 1 :blueprint it's actually a place for us
 to build startups from scratch so we often bring in found this and work withthem or maybe even have existing ideas
 that we match founders with and then this launches yo hopefully intosuccessful companies so how close are


Speaker 0 :you to figuring out a way to automate
 the process of starting from scratch and building successful AI startup yeah I

Speaker 1 :think we've we've been constantly
 improving and iterating on our processes but how we do that so things like youknow how many customer calls do we need
 to make and all they get customer validation how do we make sure thistechnology can be built
 well all of our businesses need cutting-edge machine learning algorithmsso you know kind of Alrosa develop in
 the last one or two years and even if it works in a research paper it turns outtaking the production it's really hard a
 lot of issues for making these things work in the real life didn't know whythe actress in academia so how do you
 validate is actually doable how do you build ateam get the specialize domain knowledge
 speed in education or healthcare or whatever staffing are focusing on so Ithink we're actually getting we've been
 getting much better at giving the entrepreneurs a high success rate but Ithink we're still I think the whole
 world is still in the early phases freaking us out but do you think there

Speaker 0 :is some aspects of that process the
 transferable from one startup to another to another to another yeah very much so

Speaker 1 :you know starting a company to most
 entrepreneurs is is a really lonely thing and I've seen so manyentrepreneurs not know how to make a
 certain decision like when do you need - how do you do PDP sales right if youdon't know that this is really hard or
 how do you market this efficiently other than you're buying ads which is reallyexpensive
 other more efficient tactics that know from machine learning project you knowbasic decisions can change the course of
 whether machine learning product works or not and so there are so many hundredsof decisions that entrepreneurs need to
 make and making a mistake in a couple of key decisions can have a huge impact onthe fate of the company so I think a
 starter studio provides a support structure that makes starting a companymuch less of a lonely experience and
 also um when facing with these key decisions like trying to hire your firstthe VP of Engineering what's a good
 selection criteria do you sauce should I hire this person or not but helping byhaving by having an ecosystem around the
 entrepreneurs the founders to hope I think we help them at the key momentsand hopefully cyclically
 make them more enjoyable and in higher success rate there's somebody to

Speaker 0 :brainstorm with in these very difficult
 decision points and also to help then

Speaker 1 :recognize what they may not even realize
 is a key decision point right that's

Speaker 0 :that's the first probably the most


Speaker 1 :important part yeah you can say one
 other thing um you know I think the building companies is one thing but Ifeel like is really important that we
 build companies move the world forward for exampleLavinia funteam does once an idea for a
 new company that if it had succeeded but have resulted in people watching a lotmore videos in a certain narrow vertical
 type of video looked at it the business case was fine the revenue case was finebut a look that I just said I don't want
 to do this that you know I don't actually just want to have a lot morepeople watch this type of video wasn't
 educational is the educational Haiti and so and so III code the idea on the basisthat didn't think it would actually help
 people so what the building companies or work of enterprises or doing personalprojects I think it's up to each of us
 to figure out what's the difference we want to make in the world with learning

Speaker 0 :AI you helped already established
 companies grow their AI and machine learning efforts how does a largecompany integrate machine learning into


Speaker 1 :their efforts AI is a general purpose
 technology and I think it will transform every industry our community has alreadytransformed the logic center software
 internet sector most software internet companies outside the top right five orsix or three or four already have
 reasonable machine learning capabilities or or getting there is still room forimprovement but when I look outside the
 software internet sector everything from manufacturing agriculture healthcarethey're just X translation there's so
 many opportunities that very few people are working on so I think the next wayfor AI is first also transform all of
 those other industries there was a McKinsey study estimating 13 trilliondollars of global economic growth the
 u.s. GDP is 19 trillion dollars or thirteen trillion this is a big numberor PwC it's been 16 trillion dollars so
 whatever number is this large but the interesting thing to me was a lot ofthat impact would be outside the
 software internet sector so we need more teams to work with these companies tohelp them adopt AI and I think this is
 one things that make you hope drive global economic growth and make humanity

Speaker 0 :more powerful and like you said the
 impact is there so what are the best industries the biggest industries whereAI can
 perhaps outside the software tech sector

Speaker 1 :um frankly I think is all of them some
 of the ones I'm spending a lot of time on are manufacturing agriculture lookingto healthcare for example in
 manufacturing we do a lot of our work in visual inspection where today there arepeople standing around using the AI
 humanoid to check it you know this plastic part or the smartphone or thisthing has a stretch or gentle something
 in it um we can use a camera to take a picture use a algorithm deep learningand other things to check if it's
 defective or not and does our factories improve you then improve quality andimprove throughput it turns out the
 practical problems we run into are very different than the ones you might readabout in most research papers the data
 says they're really small so if a small D the problems you're the factories keepon changing the environment so it works
 well on your test set but guess what you know the something changes in thefactory the lights go on they're off
 recently we there was a factory in which M burned through through the factory andpooped on something and so that you know
 so that changed stuff and so increasing our algorithm of making robustness soall the changes happen the factory I
 find that we runs a lot of practical problems that that are not as widelydiscussed in in academia and is really
 fun kind of being on the cutting edge solving these problems before you knowmaybe before many people are even aware
 that there is a problem there and that's

Speaker 0 :such a fascinating space you're
 absolutely right but what is the first step that a company should take it'sjust scary leap into this new world of
 going from the human eye inspecting to digitizing that process having a camerahaving an algorithm what's the first
 step like what's the early journey that you recommend that you see these

Speaker 1 :companies taking I published a document
 called the AI transformation playbook that's online and talk briefly ifeveryone course on Coursera about the
 long term journey that companies should take but the first step is actually tostart small I've seen lot more companies
 fail by starting to bake than by starting to small um take even Googleyou know most people
 realize how hard it was and how controversial was in the early days sowhen it's not the Google brain um it was
 controversial you know people thought deep-learningNunez tried it didn't work why would you
 want to do deep learning so my first internal customer rule inGoogle was the Google speech team which
 is not the most lucrative project in Google but not the most important it'snot web search or advertising but by
 starting small on my team helped the speech team build a more accurate speechrecognition system and this caused their
 peers other teams to start at more faith and deep learning my second internalcustomer was the Google Maps team where
 we use computer vision to read house numbers from basic Street view imagesthe more accurately locate houses within
 Google Maps so improve the quality later and there's only after those twosuccesses that I then started the most
 serious conversation with a Google Ads team and so there's a ripple effect that

Speaker 0 :you showed that it works in these in
 this cases and then it just propagates through the entire company that thisthis thing has a lot of value and use


Speaker 1 :for us I think the early small-scale
 projects it helps the teams gain faith but also hosts the team's learn whatthese technologies do I still remember
 when our first GPU server it was a server under some guys desk and you knowand and then that taught us early
 important lessons about how do you have multiple users share a set of GPUs whichis really non-obvious at the time but
 those early lessons were important we learned a lot from that first GPU serverthen later helped the teams think
 through how to scale without too much large deployments are there concrete

Speaker 0 :challenges that companies face that the
 UC is important for them to solve I

Speaker 1 :think building and deploying machine
 learning systems is hard there's a huge gulf between something that works and Idrew the notebook on your laptop versus
 something runs their production deployment setting in a factory orculture plant or whatever um so I see a
 lot of people you know get something to work on your laptop you say wow lookwithout done and that's that's that's
 great that's hot that's a very important first step but all teams underestimatethe rest of the steps
 um so for example I've heard this exact same conversation between a lot ofmachine learning people and
 businesspeople the machine learning person says look myalgorithm does well on the test set and
 the clean test said I didn't a peak and then machine and the business personsays thank you very much but your
 algorithm sucks it doesn't work and the machine learning person says no wait Idid well on the test set um and I think
 there is a gulf between what it takes to do well on a test set on your hard driveversus what it takes to work well in a
 deployment setting some some common problems robustus in generalization youknow yuuta for something the factory
 maybe they chopped down a tree outside the factory so the tree no longer coversthe window and the lighting is different
 so the first set changes and in machine learning and especially in academia wedon't know how to deal with test set
 distributions that are dramatically different than the training setdistribution this research there's stuff
 like domain annotation transfer learning you know that the people working on itbut we're really not good at this
 so how do you actually get this to work because your test set distribution isgoing to change and I think um also if
 you look at the number of lines of code in a software system the machinelearning model it's maybe five percent
 or even fewer relative to the entire software system we need to build so howto get all that work done and make it
 reliable and systematic a good software

Speaker 0 :engineering work is fundamental here to
 building a successful small machine

Speaker 1 :learning system yes and and and the
 software system needs to interface with people's work clothes so machinelearning is automation on steroids
 if we take one task all the many tasks that done in factories so in factorydoes lots of things one tosses visual
 inspection if we automate that one task it can be really valuable but you mayneed to redesign a lot of other tasks
 around that one task for example say the machine learning algorithm says this isdefective what is supposed to do is you
 throw the way to get a human to double check do you want to rework it or fix itso you need to redesign a lot of toss
 around that thing you've now automated soplanning for the change management and
 making sure that the software he write is consistent with the new work thoughand you take the time to explain to
 people when he so happens I think what Lani AI has become good at and I thinkwe learned by making mistakes and you
 know painful experiences for my ring what would become good at is workingwith our partners to think through all
 the things beyond just the machine learning model don't you put a notebookbut build the entire system manage the
 change process and figure out how to deploy this in a way that has an actualimpact the processes that the large
 software tech companies use for deploying don't work for a lot of otherscenarios there for example when I was
 leading you know large speech teams um if the speech my vision system goes downwhat happens what allowance goes off and
 then someone like me will say hey you 20 engineers please fix this baby with anAmerican but if you have a system garden
 in the factory there are not 20 machine learning engineers sitting around youcan page the duty and have them fix it
 so how do you deal with the maintenance or the or the DevOps or the mo ops orthe other aspects of this so these are
 concepts that I think landing AI and a few other teams on the cutting edge uhbut we don't even have systematic
 terminology yet to describe some of the stuff we do because I think we're we'reindenting it on the fly so you mentioned


Speaker 0 :some people are interested in
 discovering mathematical beauty and truth in the universe and you'reinterested in having big positive impact
 in the world so let me ask the two are

Speaker 1 :not inconsistent no they're all together


Speaker 0 :I'm only half joking because you're
 probably interested a little bit in both but let me ask a romanticized questionso much of the work your work and our
 discussion today has been on the applied AI maybe you can even call narrow AIwhere the goal is to create systems that
 automate some specific process that adds a lot of value to the world but there'sanother branch of AI starting with Alan
 Turing the kind of dreams of creating human level or superhuman levelintelligence is this something you dream
 of as well do you think we human beings will ever build a human levelthey're superhuman level intelligent


Speaker 1 :system I would love to get the AGI and I
 think humanity will but whether it takes a hundred years or 500 or 5,000 I find

Speaker 0 :hard to estimate do you have some folks
 have worries about the different trajectories that path would take evenexistential threats of an AGI system do
 you have such concerns whether in the

Speaker 1 :short term or the long term I do worry
 about the long term fate of humanity um I do wonder as well I do worry aboutoverpopulation on the planet Mars just
 not today I think there will be a day when maybemaybe someday in the future mass will be
 polluted there are these children dying and some will look back at this videoand say Andrew how is Anja so heartless
 you didn't care about all these children dying on the planet Mars and I apologizeto the future viewer I do care about the
 children but I just don't know how to productively work on that today your

Speaker 0 :picture will be in the dictionary for
 the people who are ignorant about the overpopulation on Mars okay yes so it'sa long term problem is there something
 in the short term we should be thinking about in terms of aligning the values ofour AI systems with the values of us
 humans sort of something this to Russell and other folks are thinking about asthis system develops more and more we
 want to make sure that it represents the better angels of our naturethe ethics the values of our society you


Speaker 1 :know if you take so driving cars um the
 biggest problem with self-driving cars is not that there's some trolley dilemmaand you teach this so you know how many
 times when you're driving your car did you face this moral dilemma as it wouldI food I crash into you so I think
 itself Giancarlo runs that problem roughly as often as we do when we driveour cars um the biggest problem Sir John
 calls is when there's a big white truck across the road and what you should dois break and not crash into it and the
 search on car fails and it crashes into it so I think we need to solve thatproblem for us I think the problem with
 some of these discussions about a gi you know alignments the paperclipproblem is that is a huge distraction
 from the much harder problems that we actually need to address today some hardproblems yesterday
 I think I'm bias is a huge issue um I worry about wealth inequality the AI andInternet are causing an acceleration of
 concentration of power because we can now centralized data use there toprocess it and so industry after
 industry we've affected every industry so the internet industry has a lot ofwinner-take- modes are willing to take
 all dynamics but if infected all these other industries so also giving theseother industries when they take most I'm
 going to take all flavors so look at what uber and lyft into the taxiindustry so we're doing this type of
 things along so this so creating tremendous wealth but how do we shoulderthe wealth is fairly shared I think that
 and then how do we help people whose jobs are displace you know I thinkeducation is part of it there may be
 even more that we need to do then education I think bias is a seriousissue there adverse users of AI and like
 deep fakes being used for various nefarious purposes so I worry about someteams maybe accidentally and I hope not
 deliberately making a lot of noise about things that problems in the distantfuture rather than focusing on senses
 much harder problems

Speaker 0 :yeah the overshadow the problems that we
 have already today they're exceptionally challenging like those you said and eventhe silly ones but the ones that have a
 huge impact which is the lighting variation outside of your factory windowthat that ultimately is what makes the
 difference between like you said the jupiter notebook and something thatactually transforms an entire industry
 potentially yeah and I think and then

Speaker 1 :just to some companies when a regulator
 comes to you and says no your product is messing things up fixing it may have arevenue impact was much more fun to talk
 to them about how you promise not to wipe out humanity in this interfacethey're actually really hard problems we
 face so your life has been a great

Speaker 0 :journey from teaching to research to
 entrepreneurship two questions one are there regretsmoments that if you went back you would
 do differently and two are there moments you're especially proud of moments thatmade you truly happy you know I've made


Speaker 1 :so many mistakes it feels like every
 time I discover something I go why didn't I think of this you know fiveyears earlier or even ten years earlier
 and Reese's and then sometimes I read a book and I go I wish I read this bookten years ago my life we've been so
 different although that happened recently and then I was thinking if onlyI read this book when we're a start-up
 Coursera could have been so much better but Idiscovered that book had not yet been
 written we're starting Coursera so that means even but I find that the processof discovery we keep on finding out
 things that seem so obvious in hindsight but it always takes us so much longerthan then I wish to figure it out so on


Speaker 0 :the second question are there moments in
 your life that if you look back that you're especially proud of or especiallyhappy the that fills you with happiness


Speaker 1 :and fulfillment well two answers one
 despite all turnover yes of course you say no matter how much time I spend forI just can't spend enough time with her
 congratulations weather thank you and then second is helping other people Ithink to me I think the meaning of life
 is um helping others achieve whatever are their dreams and then also to try tomove the world forward by making
 humanity more powerful as a whole so the times that I felt most happy most proudworks when I felt um someone else
 allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit on the path to theirdreams I think there's no better way to


Speaker 0 :end it than talking about happiness and
 the meaning of life so enter it's a huge honor me and millions of people thankyou for all the work you've done thank
 you for talking to thank you so much

Speaker 1 :thanks
