Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Harry Cliff a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge working on theLarge Hadron Collider beauty experiment
 that specializes in investigating the slight differences between matter andantimatter by studying a type of
 particle called the beauty quark or B quark in this way he's part of the groupof physicists who are searching for the
 evidence of new particles that can answer some of the biggest questions inmodern physics

 coolest things that human beings have ever created the Large Hadron Colliderohc what is it how does it work


0:04:01
Speaker 0 :okay so is essentially this gigantic 27
 kilometer circumference particle accelerators this big ring it's buried100 100 meters underneath the surface in
 the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland and really what it's forultimately is to try to understand what
 are the basic building blocks of the universe so you can think of it in a wayas like a gigantic microscope and and
 the analogy is actually fairly precise

0:04:28
Speaker 1 :so gigantic microscope effectively


0:04:29
Speaker 0 :except it's a microscope that looks at
 the structure of the vacuum in order for

0:04:35
Speaker 1 :this kind of thing to study particles
 which are microscopic entities it has to be huge yes gigantic Waxhaw so what do

0:04:48
Speaker 0 :you mean by studying vacuum okay so I
 mean so particle physics as a field is kind of badly named in a way becauseparticles are not the fundamental
 ingredients of the universe they're not fundamental at all so the things that webelieve are the real building blocks of
 the universe are objects invisible fluid like objects called quantum fields sothese are fields like like the magnetic
 field around a magnet that exists everywhere in space they're always therein fact actually it's funny they were in
 the wrong institution because this is where the idea of the field waseffectively invented by Michael Faraday
 doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire so he noticed that you know ifhe was very famous experiment that he
 did where he got a magnet and put it on top of it a piece of paper and thensprinkled iron filings and he found the
 iron filings arrange themselves into these kind of loops of which wasactually mapping out the invisible
 influence of this magnetic field which is a thing you know we've allexperienced we're all felt held a magnet
 and or two poles the magnet and pushing together and felt this thing this forcepushing back so these are real physical
 objects and the the way we think of particles in modern physics is that theyare essentially little vibrations little
 ripples in these otherwise invisible fields that are everywhere they fill the

0:06:02
Speaker 1 :whole universe you know I don't
 apologist perhaps for the ridiculous question are you comfortable with theidea of the fundamental nature of our
 reality being fields because to me particles you know a bunch of differentbuilding blocks makes more sense sort of
 intellectually so visually like it's it it seems to I seem to be able tovisualize that kind of idea easier yeah
 are you comfortable psychologically with the idea that the basic building blockis not a block but a field I think it's


0:06:35
Speaker 0 :um I think it's quite a magical idea I
 find it quite appealing and it's well it comes from a misunderstanding of whatparticles are so like when you when we
 do science at school and we draw a picture of an atom you draw a like youknow nucleus with some protons or
 neutrons these little spheres in the middle and then you have some electronsare like little flies flying around the
 atom and that is a completely misleading picture of what an atom is like it'snothing like that the electron is not
 like a little planet orbiting the atom it's this spread out wibbly-wobblywave-like thing and we know we've known
 that since you know the early 20th century thanks to quantum mechanics sowhen we carry on using this word
 particle because sometimes when we do experiments particles do behave likethey're little marbles or little bullets
 you know so in the LHC when we collide particles together you'll get you knowyou'll get like hundreds of particles
 will fly out through the detector and they all take a trajectory and you cansee from the detector where they've gone
 and they look like they're little bullets so they behave that way um youknow a lot of the time but when you
 really study them carefully you'll see that they are not little spheres theyare these virial disturbances in in
 these underlying fields so this is this is really how we think nature is whichis surprising but also I think kind of
 magic so here we are our bodies are basically made up of like little knotsof energy in these invisible objects


0:08:00
Speaker 1 :that are all around us and what what is
 the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC so what why did you mention the word

0:08:09
Speaker 0 :vacuum okay so if we just if we go back
 to let us the physics we do know so atoms are made of electrons which werediscovered 100 or so years ago and then
 nucleus of the atom you have two other types of particles there's an upsomething called an up quark and a down
 quark and those three particles make up every atom in the universe so we thinkof these as ripples in fields so there
 is something called the electron field and every electron in the universe is aripple moving about in this electron
 field the electron field is all around we can't see it but every electron inour body is a little ripple in this
 thing that's there all the time and the quark feels the same so there's an upquark field and an up quark isn't a
 ripple in the up quark field and the down quark is a little ripple insomething else called the down quark
 field so these fields are always there now there are potentially we know abouta certain number of fields in what we
 call the standard model of particle physics and the most recent one wediscovered was the Higgs field and the
 way we discovered the Higgs field was to make a little ripple in it so what theLHC did it fired two protons into each
 other very very hard with enough energy that you could create a disturbance inthis Higgs field and that's what shows
 up as what we call the Higgs boson so this particle that everyone was going onabout eight or so years ago is proof
 really the particle in itself is I mean it's interesting but the things reallyinteresting is the field because it's
 the the Higgs field that we believe is the reason that electrons and quarkshave mass and it's that invisible field
 that's always there that gives mass to the particles the Higgs boson is justour way of checking it's there basically


0:09:46
Speaker 1 :and so the Large Hadron Collider in
 order to get that ripple in the Higgs field you it requires a huge amount ofenergy
 yes opposes so that's why you need this huge that's why size matters here somaybe there's a million questions here
 but let's backtrack why does size matter in the context of a particle collider sowhy does bigger allow you for higher


0:10:15
Speaker 0 :energy collisions right so the reason
 well it is kind of simple really which is that there are two types of particleaccelerator that you can build one is
 circular which is like the LHC the other is a great long line so the advantage ofa circular machine is that you can send
 particles around a ring and you can give them a kick everyand they go round so imagine you have a
 is actually a bit of the LHC that's about only 30 meters long where you havea bunch of metal boxes which have
 oscillating to million volt electric fields inside them which are timed sothat when a proton goes through one of
 these boxes the field it sees as it approaches is attractive then as itleaves the box it flips and becomes
 repulsive and the proton gets attracted then kicked out the other side so itgets a bit faster so you send it but
 then you send it back round again and

0:10:56
Speaker 1 :it's incredible like the timing of that
 the synchronization that wait really yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I thinkthere's going to be a multiplicative
 effect on the questions I have is that okay let me just take that attention fora second how the orchestration of that
 is that a fundamentally a hardware problem or software a problem like what

0:11:19
Speaker 0 :how do you get that I mean I might so I
 should first of all say I'm not an engineer so the guys I did not build theLHC so they're people much much better


0:11:26
Speaker 1 :at this stuff than I for sure but maybe
 but from from your sort of intuition from the the the echoes of what youunderstand you heard of house design
 what's your sense how what's the engineering aspects that the

0:11:43
Speaker 0 :acceleration bit is not challenging okay
 okay there is always challenges everything but basically you have thesethe beams that go around you like see
 the beams of particles are divided into little bunches so they're called theirbit like swarms of bees if you like and
 there are around I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches spaced aroundthe ring and they if you were if you're
 a given point on the ring counting bunches you get 40 million bunchespassing you every second so they come in
 like you know just like cars going past from a very fast motorway so you need tohave if you're a electric field that
 you're using to accelerate the particles that needs to be timed so that as abunch of protons arrives it's got the
 right sign to attract them and then flips at the right moment but I thinkthe the voltage in those boxes
 oscillates at hundreds of megahertz so the beams at like 40 megahertz but isoscillating much more quickly than the
 beam so and I think you know it's difficult engineering but in principleit's not you know a really serious
 challenge the bigger problem this

0:12:41
Speaker 1 :probably engineers like screaming at


0:12:43
Speaker 0 :ureña probably yeah
 what okay so in terms of coming back to thisthing why is it so big well the reason
 is you wanna get the particles through that accelerating element over overagain so you want to bring them back
 round that's why it's round the question is why couldn't you make it smaller wellthe basic answer is that these particles
 are going unbelievably quickly so they travel at 99.999999 1% of the speed oflight in the LHC and if you think about
 say driving your car round a corner high speed if you go fast you need a very youneed a lot of friction in the tires to
 make sure you don't slide off the road so the the limiting factor is the howpowerful a magnet can you make because
 it's what we do is magnets are used to bend the particles around the ring andessentially the LHC when it was designed
 was designed with the most powerful magnets that could conceivably be builtat the time and so that's your kind of
 limiting factors if you wanted to make the machines smaller that means atighter bend you need to have a more
 powerful magnet so it's this toss-up between how strong your magnets versushow big a tunnel can you afford the
 bigger the tunnel the weaker the magnets can be the smaller a tunnel the stronger

0:13:53
Speaker 1 :they've got to be okay so maybe can we
 backtrack to the data model and say what kind of particles there are period andmaybe the history of kind of assembling
 that the standard model of physics and then how that leads up to the hopes anddreams and the accomplishments of the
 Large Hadron Collider yeah sure okay so

0:14:13
Speaker 0 :for all the 20th century physics in like
 five minutes yeah please okay so okay the storyreally begins properly end of the 19th
 century the basic view of matter is that matter is made of atoms and the atomsare indestructible immutable little
 spheres like the things we were talking about they don't really exist andthere's you know one atom for every
 chemical element as an atom for hydrogen for helium for carbon photon etc andthey're all different
 then in 1897 experiments done at the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge whereI am still where I'm based showed that
 there are actually smaller particles inside the atom which eventually becameknown as electrons these are these
 negatively charged things that go around the outside a few years later and it'sRutherford very famous nuclear physics
 nuclear physics shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center which wecall the nucleus which is a positively
 charged object so then by in light 1910-11 we have this model of the atomthat we learn in school which is you've
 got a nucleus electrons go round there fast forward you know a few years thenucleus people start doing experiments
 with radioactivity where they use alpha particles that are spat out ofradioactive elements as as bullets and
 they fire them other atoms and by banging things into each other they seethat they can knock bits out of the
 nucleus so these things come out called protons first of all which arepositively charged particles about 2,000
 times heavier than the electron and then 10 years later more or less neutralparticle is discovered called the
 neutron so those are the three basic building blocks of atoms you haveprotons and neutrons in the nucleus that
 are stuck together by something called a strong force the strong nuclear forceand you have electrons in orbit around
 that held in by the electromagnetic force which is one of the you know theforces of nature that's sort of where we
 get to by late 1932 more or less then what happens is physics is nice and neatin 1932 everything looks great got three
 particles and all the atoms are made of that's fine but then cloud chamberexperiments these are devices that can
 be used to the first devices capable of imaging subatomic particles so you cansee their tracks and they use to study
 cosmic rays particles that come from outer space and bang into the atmosphereand in these experiments people start to
 see a whole load of new particles so they discover for one thing antimatterwhich is a sort of a mirror image of the
 particles so we discovered that there's also as well as a negatively chargedelectron there's something called a
 positron which is a positively charged version of the electron and there's anantiproton which is negatively charged
 and and then a whole load of other weird particle start to get discovered and noone really knows what they are this is
 known as the zoo of particles are these

0:16:50
Speaker 1 :discoveries fundamentally first
 theoretical discoveries or the discoveries in an experiment so likewell yeah what was the process of
 discovery for these early it's a mixture

0:17:02
Speaker 0 :I mean that the early stuff around the
 atom is really experimentally driven it's not based on some theory it'sexploration in the lab using equipment
 so it's really people just figuring out hands-on with the fenomena figuring outwhat these things are the theory comes a
 bit later that there is that's not always the case so in the discovery ofthe anti-electron the positron that was
 predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity by a very clever theoreticalphysicist called Paul Dirac who was
 probably the second brightest you know physicist of the 20th century apart fromEinstein but isn't as well anywhere near
 as well known so he predicted the existence of the anti electron frombasically a combination of the theories
 of quantum mechanics and relativity and it was discovered about a year after he

0:17:45
Speaker 1 :made their prediction what happens when
 an electron meets a positron they

0:17:48
Speaker 0 :annihilate each other so if you when you
 bring a particle in its antiparticle together they they react well they reactthey just wipe each other out and they
 turn their mass is turned into energy usually in the form of photons so you'll

0:18:02
Speaker 1 :get light produced so when you have that
 kind of situation why why does the universe exists at all if there's matterin any matter oh god now we're getting


0:18:10
Speaker 0 :into the really big questions so you
 want to go there now yeah that's me maybe let's go there

0:18:16
Speaker 1 :later that's because I mean that is a


0:18:18
Speaker 0 :

0:18:20
Speaker 1 :very big question yeah let's let's take
 it slow with the standard model so okay so there's matter and antimatter in the30s mmm


0:18:28
Speaker 0 :so what else so matter antimatter and
 then a load of new particles start turning up in these cosmic rayexperiments first of all and they don't
 seem to be particles that make up atoms there's something else they all mostlyinteract with a strong nuclear force so
 they're a bit like protons and neutrons and by in the 1960s in Americaparticularly but also in Europe and
 Russia scientist article particle accelerators so these are theforerunners of the LHC so big ring
 shaped machines that were you know hundreds of meters long which in thosedays was enormous you never you know
 most physics up until that point had been done in labs in universities youknow with small bits of kit so this is a
 big change and when these accelerators are built they start to find they canproduce even more of these particles so
 I don't know the exact numbers but by around 1960 there are of order a hundredof these things that have been
 discovered and physicists are kind of tearing the hair out because physics isall about simplification and suddenly
 what was simple as come messy and complicated and everyonesort of wants to understand what's going


0:19:31
Speaker 1 :on it's a quick kind of a side and the
 probably really dumb question but how is it possible to take something like alike a photon or electron and be able to
 control it enough like to be able to do a controlled experiment where youcollide it against something else
 yeah is that is that that seems like an exceptionally difficult engineeringchallenge because you mention vacuum to
 so you basically want to remove every other distraction and really focus onthis collision how difficult of an
 engineering challenge is that just to

0:20:07
Speaker 0 :get a sense and it's very hard I mean in
 the early days particularly when the first accelerators are being built inlike 1932 Ernest Lawrence builds the
 first what we call the cyclotron which is like a little celery - this big or sothere's another widely they're big
 there's a tiny little thing yeah I mean so most of the first accelerators werewhat we call fixed argot experiments so
 you had a ring you accelerate particles around the ring and then you fire themout the side into some target so is eat
 that makes the kind of the colliding bit is relatively straightforward to usefire it whatever it is you want to fire
 it out the hard bit is the steering the beams with the magnetic fields gettingyou know strong enough electric fields
 to accelerate them all that kind of stuffthe first colliders where you have two
 beams colliding head-on that comes later and I don't think it's done until maybethe 1980s
 I'm not entirely sure but it takes is much harder problem that's crazy because

0:21:05
Speaker 1 :yet it's like perfectly you had them to
 hit each other I mean we're talking about I mean what scale it takes what'sthis this I mean the temporal thing is a
 giant mess but the spatially like the size mmm it's tiny well to give you a

0:21:23
Speaker 0 :sense so the LHC beams the
 cross-sectional diameter is I think around a dozen or so microns so you knowten ten millionths of a meters then a


0:21:36
Speaker 1 :beam sorry just to clarify a beam
 how many is it the bunches that you mentioned yes multiple poles is just one

0:21:44
Speaker 0 :part oh no no the bunches contained say
 a hundred billion protons each so a bunch is not really one shape they'reactually quite long they're like 30
 centimeters long but thinner than a human hair so like very very narrow longsort of object so those are the things
 so what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams so that they cross in themiddle of the detector so the basically
 have these swarms of protons are flying through each other and most of that youhave so you have 100 billion coming one
 way 100 billion another way maybe 10 of them will hit each other okay so this

0:22:16
Speaker 1 :okay that makes a lot more sense that's
 nice so there you're trying to use sort of it's like probabilistically you're

0:22:23
Speaker 0 :not you can't make a single particle
 collide with a single oh yeah so that's not an efficient way to do it you'd bewaiting a very long time to get anything


0:22:30
Speaker 1 :yeah so you you're basically right see
 you're relying on probability to be that some fraction of them are gonna collideyeah and then you know which is it's
 it's a it's a swarm of the same kind of particle so it doesn't matter which ones

0:22:44
Speaker 0 :each other exactly I mean that that's
 not to say it's not hard you've got a one of the challenges to make thecollisions work is you have to squash
 these beams to very very the basic their narrower they are the better because thehigher the chances of them colliding if
 you think about two flocks of birds flying through each otherthe birds are all far apart in the
 flocks there's not much chance that they'll collide if they're all flyingdensely together and they very much more
 likely to collide with each other so that's the sort of problem it's tuningthose magnetic fields getting them angry
 feels powerful not that you squash the beams and focus them so that you getenough collisions that's super cool do


0:23:17
Speaker 1 :you know how much software is involved
 here I mean it's sort of I come in the software world and it's fascinating thisseems like it's a software is buggy and
 messy and so like you almost don't want to rely on software too much like if youdo it has to be like low-level like
 Fortran style programming do you know how much software isn't a Large Hadron

0:23:39
Speaker 0 :Collider I mean it depends at which
 level a lot I mean the whole thing is obviously computer-controlled so I meanI I don't know a huge amount about how
 the software for the actual accelerator works but you know I've been in thecontrol center so has CERN there's this
 big control room which is like bit like a NASA mission control with bigbanks of you know desk where the engine
 is sit and they monitor the LHC because you obviously can't be in the tunnelwhen it's running so everything's remote
 I mean one sort of anecdote about the sort of software side in 2008 when theLHC first switched on they had this big
 launch event and then you know big press conference party to inaugurate themachine and about ten days after that
 they were doing some tests and the this dramatic event happened where a hugeexplosion basically took place in a
 tunnel that destroyed were damaged badly damaged about about half a kilometer ofthe machine but the story is viewed the
 engineers here in the control room that day they'd one guy told me the storyabout you know basically there's all
 these screens they have in the control room started going red so these alarmslike you know kind of in software going
 off and then they assume that lists all wrong with the software cuz there's noway something this catastrophic could
 have could have happened yeah but I mean when I worked on one when I was a PhDstudent one of my Jobs was to help to
 maintain the software that's used to control the detector that we work on andthat was it's relatively robust not so
 you don't want it to be too fancy you don't want to sort of fall over tooeasily the more clever stuff comes when
 you're talking about analyzing the data and that's where they're sort of you

0:25:10
Speaker 1 :know are we jumping around too much do
 we finish for the standard model we didn't know we didn't hurry and start

0:25:16
Speaker 0 :talking mark works we haven't talked
 about me yet got to the messy zoo of

0:25:21
Speaker 1 :particles go back there if it's okay
 okay that's take us the rest of the history of physics in the 20th century

0:25:27
Speaker 0 :okay sure
 okay so circa 1960 you have this you have these hundred or so particles it'sa bit like the periodic table all over
 again so you've got like like having a hundred elements sort of a bit like thatand people try to start to try to impose
 some order so Murray Gelman he's a theoretical physicist American from NewYork he realizes that there are these
 symmetries in these particles that if you arrange them in certain ways thatthey relate to each other and he uses
 these symmetry principles to predict the existence of particles that haven't beendiscovered which are then discovered in
 accelerators so this starts to suggest there's not just random collections ofcrap there's like you know actually some
 order to this under a little bit later in 1960 again it'sround the 1960s he proposes along with
 another physicist called George Zweig the these symmetries arise because justlike the patterns in the periodic table
 arise because atoms are made of electrons and protons that thesepatterns are due to the fact that these
 particles are made of smaller things and they are called quarks so these are theparticles they're predicted from theory
 for a long time no one really believes they're real a lot of people think thatthere are kind of theoretical
 convenience that happen to fit the data but there's no evidence no one's everseen a quark in any experiment and lots
 of experiments are done to try to find quarks just try to knock a quark out ofher so the idea if protons and neutrons
 say made of quarks you should work to knock a quark out and see the quark thatnever happens and we still have never
 actually managed to do that really no so the way but the way that it's done inthe end is this machine that's built in
 California at Stanford lab Stanford Linear Accelerator which is essentiallya gigantic three kilometer long electron
 gun fires electrons almost speed of light at protons and when you do theseexperiments what you find is a very high
 energy the electrons bounce off small hard objects inside the proton so it's abit like taking an x-ray of the proton
 you're firing these very light high-energy particles and they'repinging off little things inside the
 proton that are like ball bearings if you like so you actually that way theyresolve that there are three things
 inside the proton which are quarks the quarks that governance why I couldpredicted so that's really the evidence
 that convinces people that these things are real the fact that we've never seenone in an experiment directly they're
 always stuck inside other particles and the reason for that is essentially to dowith the strong force the strong forces
 the force holds quarks together and it's so strongly it's impossible to actuallyliberate a quark so if you try and pull
 a quark out of a proton what actually ends up happening is that the you kindof create this that this spring-like
 bond in the strong force we've imagined two quarks that are held together byvery powerful spring you pull it pull
 and pull more and more energy gets stored in therebond like stretching a spring and
 eventually the tension gets so great the spring snaps and the energy in that bondgets turned into two new quarks that go
 on the broken ends so you started with two quarks to end up with four quarksso you never actually get to take a
 quark out you just end up making loads of more quarks in the process so how do

0:28:39
Speaker 1 :we again forgive the dumb question how
 do we know quarks are real then well eh

0:28:45
Speaker 0 :from these experiments where we can
 scatter you fire electrons into the protons they can burrow into the protonand knock off and they can bounce off
 these quarks so you can see from the angles the electrons come Alice you caninfer you can infer that these things
 are there the quark model can also be used it has a lot of successes you canuse it to predict the existence of new
 particles that hadn't been seen so and basically there's lots of data basicallyshowing from you know when we fire
 protons at each other at the LHC a lot of quarks get knocked all over the placeand every time they try and escape from
 say one of their protons they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying offit has bound up in other sorts of
 particles made of quarks so they're all the sort of the theoretical predictionsfrom the basic theory of the strong
 force and the quarks all agrees with what we are seeing experiments we'vejust never seen a an actual quark on its
 own because unfortunate it's impossible to get them out on their own

0:29:40
Speaker 1 :so quarks these crazy smaller things
 that are hard to imagine a real so what else what else is part of the story here

0:29:49
Speaker 0 :so the other thing that's going on at
 the time around the sixties it's an attempt to understand the forces thatmake these particles interact with each
 other so you have the electromagnetic force which is the force that was sortof discovered to some extent in this
 room or at least in this building so the first what we call quantum field theoryof the electromagnetic force is
 developed in the 1940s and 50s by Fineman Richard Feynman amongst otherpeople julian schwinger tominaga who
 come up with the first what we call a quantum field theory of theelectromagnetic force and this is where
 this description of which I gave you at the beginning that particles are ripplesand fields well in this theory the
 photon the particle of light is described aspeople in this quantum field called the
 electromagnetic field and the attempt then is made to try what can we come upwith a quantum field theory of the other
 forces of the strong force and the weak the other third the third force which wehaven't discussed which is the weak
 force which is a nuclear force we don't really experience it in our everydaylives but it's responsible for
 radioactive decay is the force that allows you know in a radioactive atom toturn into a different element for


0:31:00
Speaker 1 :example and there are a few we've
 explicitly mentioned but so there's technically four forces yes I guessthree of them were being in in the
 standard model like the weak there's the strong and the electromagnetic and then

0:31:14
Speaker 0 :there's gravity in this gravity which we
 don't worry about that because maybe maybe we bring that up at the end yeahgravity so far we don't have a quantum
 theory of and if you can solve that problem you win a Nobel Prize well we're

0:31:25
Speaker 1 :gonna have to bring up the graviton at
 some point I'm gonna ask you but let's let's leave that to the side for now sothose three okay fine man a
 electromagnetic force the the quantum field yeah where does the weak force

0:31:41
Speaker 0 :come in so so yeah well first of I mean
 the strong force a bit easiest the strong force is a little bit like theelectromagnetic force it's a force that
 binds things together so that's the force that holds quarks together insidethe proton for example so a quantum
 field theory of that force is discovered in I think it's in the sixties and itpredicts the existence of new force
 particles called gluons so gluons are a bit like the photon the photon is theparticle of electromagnetism gluons are
 the the particles of the strong force and so there's there's just like there'san electromagnetic field there's
 something called a gluon field which is also all around us but these part

0:32:19
Speaker 1 :there's some of these particles I guess
 the force carriers or whatever they

0:32:23
Speaker 0 :carry that well it depends how you want
 to think about it I mean really the field the strong force field the gluonfield is the thing that binds the quarks
 together the gluons are the little ripples in that field so that like inthe same way that the photon is a ripple
 in there in the electromagnetic field but the thing that really does thebinding is the field I mean you may have
 heard people talk about things like verge as you've heard the phrase virtualparticle
 so sometimes in some if you hear people describing how forces are exchangedbetween particles they quite often talk
 about the idea that you know if you have an electron and another electron say andthey're repelling each other through the
 electro bratok electromagnetic force you can think of that as if they'reexchanging photons so they're kind of
 firing photons backwards and forwards between each other and that causes them

0:33:10
Speaker 1 :to repel therefore time is then a
 virtual particle yes that's what we call

0:33:13
Speaker 0 :a virtual particle in other words it's
 not a real thing doesn't actually exist so it's an artifact of the way theoristsdo calculations so when they do
 calculations in quantum field theory rather than there's no one's discovereda way of just treating the whole field
 you have to break the field down into simpler things so you can basicallytreat the field as if it's made up of
 lots of these virtual photons but there's no experiment that you can dothat couldn't detect these particles
 being exchanged what's really happening in reality is the electromagnetic fieldis warped by the charge of the electron
 and that causes the force but the way we do calculations involves parties let'ssay it's a bit confusing but it is
 really a mathematical technique it's not something that corresponds to reality I

0:33:55
Speaker 1 :mean that's part I guess of the fireman
 diagrams yes is this virtual product okay that's right yeah some of thesehave mass some of them don't mm-hmm is
 that is that what what does that even mean not to have mass and maybe you cansay well which one of them's have mass


0:34:12
Speaker 0 :or which don't okay so and why is mass


0:34:13
Speaker 1 :important or relevant in this cupboard
 in this in this field view of the universe

0:34:21
Speaker 0 :well there are only two particles in the
 standard model that don't have mass which are the photon and the gluons sothey are massless particles but the
 electron the quarks and they're a bunch of other particles I haven't discussedthere's something called a muon and a
 Tau which are basically heavy versions of the electron that are unstable youcan make them in accelerators but they
 don't form atoms or anything they don't exist for long enough but all the matterparticles there are twelve of them six
 quarks and six what we call leptons which includes the electron and it's tooheavy versions and three neutrinos all
 of them have mass and so do this is the critical bit so the weak force which isthe third of these
 quantum forces which is one of the hardest to understand the forceparticles of that force have very large
 masses and there are three of them they're called the W plus the W minusand the Z boson and they have masses of
 between 80 and 90 times that of the the protons they're very heavy learn wow

0:35:26
Speaker 1 :they're very heavy things they're what


0:35:28
Speaker 0 :the heaviest I guess they're not the
 heaviest the heaviest particle is the top quark which has a mass of about 175ish protons so that's really massive we
 don't know why is so massive but they're coming back to the weak force so thatthe the problem in the 60s and 70s was
 that the reason that the electromagnetic force is a force that we can experienceour everyday live so if we have a magnet
 and a piece of metal you can hold it you know a meter apart if it's powerfullaughs and you'll feel a force whereas
 the weak force only is becomes apparent when you basically have two particlestouching at the scale of a nucleus so if
 you get two very short distances before this force becomes manifest it's notdoesn't we don't get weak forces going
 on in this room they don't notice them and the reason for that is that theparticle well the the field that
 transmits the weak force the particle that's associated with that field has avery large mass which means that the
 field dies off very quickly says you whereas an electric charge if you wereto look at the shape of the electric
 field it would fall off with this you know this one called the inverse squarelaw which is the idea that the force
 halves every time you double the distance no sorry it doesn't have itquarters every time you see every time
 you double the distance between say the two particles whereas the weak forcekind of you move a little bit away from
 the nucleus and just disappears the reason for that is because these thesefields the particles that go with them
 have a very large mass but the problem that was that theorists faced in thesixties was that if you tried to
 introduce massive force fields the theory who gave you nonsensical answersso you'd end up with infinite results
 for a lot of the calculations you tried to do so the basically it turned itseemed that quantum field theory was
 incompatible with having massive articles not just the force particlesactually but even the electron was a
 problem so this is where the Higgs that we sort of alluded to comes in and thesolution was to say okay well actually
 all the particles in the standard model of mass they have no mass so the quarksthe electron they don't have a mass
 neither do these weak particles they don't have mass either what happens isthey actually acquire mass through
 another process they get it from somewhere else they don't actually haveit intrinsically so this idea that was
 introduced by what Peter Higgs is the most famous but actually they're aboutsix people that come up with the idea
 more or less at the same time is that you introduce a new quantum field whichis another one of these invisible things
 as everywhere and it's through the interaction with this field thatparticles get mass so you can think of
 say an electron in the Higgs field it kind of Higgs field kind of bunchesaround the electron it sort of a drawn
 towards the electron and that energy that's stored in that field around theelectron is what we see as the mass of
 the electron but if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field then all theparticles in nature would become
 massless and fly around at the speed of light so this this idea of the Higgsfield allowed other people other
 theorists to come up with a well it was another a unit basically a unifiedtheory of the electromagnetic force on
 the weak force so once you bring in the Higgs field you can combine two of theforces into one so it turns out the
 electromagnetic force and the weak force are just two aspects of the samefundamental force and at the LHC we go
 to high enough energies that you see these two forces unifying effectively so

0:38:59
Speaker 1 :that so first of all it started as a
 theoretical notion like this is just something and then I mean wasn't theHiggs called the god particle at some


0:39:10
Speaker 0 :point it was by a guy trying to sell
 popular science books yeah yeah but by

0:39:15
Speaker 1 :me I am because when I was hearing it I
 thought it would I mean that would solve a lot of the you know file a lot of ourideas of physics was Molloy's my notion
 but maybe you can speak to that was is as big of a leap is it as a god particleis it a Jesus particle which which you
 know what's the big contribution of Higgs in terms of this unification power

0:39:40
Speaker 0 :yeah I mean to understand that I maybe
 helps know the history a little bit so when the what we call electroweak theorywas put together which is where you
 unify electromagnetism with the weak force and the Higgs is involved in allof that so that theory which was written
 in the mid-70s predicted the existence of four new particles the w+ boson thew- boson the z boson and the Higgs boson
 so there were these four particles that came with the theory that were predictedby the theory in 1983-84
 the W's and the z particles were discovered an accelerator at CERN calledthe super proton synchrotron which was a
 seven kilometer particle collider so three of the bits of this theory hadalready been found so people are pretty
 confident from the 80s that the Higgs must exist because it was a part of thisfamily of particles that this
 theoretical structure only works if the Higgs is there so what then happens thisquestion right why is the LHC the size
 it is yes well actually the tunnel that the LHC is in was not built for the LHCit was built from for a previous
 accelerator called the large electron positron Collider so that that was bitbegan operation in the late 80s early
 90s they basically did that's when they dug the 27 kilometer tunnel they put asaccelerator into it the collider defiers
 electrons and anti electrons at each other electrons and positrons so thepurpose of that machine was well it was
 actually to look for the Higgs that was one of the things it was trying to do itdidn't man I didn't have enough energy
 to do it in the end but the main thing it was it studied the W and the Zparticles at very high precision so it
 made loads of these things previously can you make a few of them at theprevious accelerator you could study
 these really really precisely and by studying their properties you couldreally test this electroweak theory that
 had been invented in the seventies and really make sure that it worked soactually by 1999 when this machine
 turned off people knew well okay you never know until you until you find thething but people were really confident
 electroweak theory was right and that the Higgs almost the Higgs or somethingvery like the Higgs had to exist because
 otherwise the whole thing doesn't work it'd be really weird if you coulddiscover and these particles they all
 behave exactly just theory tells you they should but somehow this key pieceof the picture isn't it's not there so
 in a way it depends how you look at it the discovery of the Higgs on its own isit's also a huge achievement in many
 both experimenting and theoretically on the other hand it's this it's likehaving a jigsaw puzzle where every piece
 has been filled in you've this beautiful image there's one gap and you kind ofknow that that piece must be there
 something right so yeah so the discovery in itself although it's important is notso interesting it's a good confirmation


0:42:30
Speaker 1 :of the obvious yes at that point but


0:42:34
Speaker 0 :what makes it interesting is not that it
 just completes the standard model which is a theory that we've known had thebasic layout offs for 40 years or more
 now it's that the Higgs actually is a is a unique particle is very different toany of the other particles in the
 standard model and it's a theoretically very troublesome particle there are alot of nasty things to do with the Higgs
 but also opportunities so that we basically don't really understand howsuch an object can exist in the form
 that it does so there are lots of reasons for thinking that the Higgs mustcome with a bunch of other particles or
 that it's perhaps made of other things so it's not a fundamental particle thatit's made of smaller things I can talk
 about that if you like a bit that's

0:43:19
Speaker 1 :that's still an ocean so yeah so the
 Higgs might not be a fundamental particle there may be some in my oh man

0:43:26
Speaker 0 :so that that is an idea it's not you
 know it's not been demonstrated to be true but I mean there's all of theseideas basically come from the fact that
 it's a this is this is a problem motivated a lot of development inphysics in the last 30 years or so and
 there's this basic fact that the higgs field which is this field that'severywhere in the universe this is the
 thing that gives mass to the particles and the Higgs field is different fromever all the other fields in that let's
 say you take the electromagnetic field which is you know if we actually were tomeasure the electromagnetic field
 we would measure all kinds of stuff going on because there's light there'sgonna be microwaves and radio waves and
 stuff but let's say we could go to a really really remote part of empty spaceand shield it and put a big box around
 it and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box the field would bealmost zero apart from some little
 quantum fluctuations but basically it goes to naught the Higgs field has avalue everywhere so it's a bit like the
 hole it's like the entire of space has got this energy stored in the Higgsfield which is not zero it's it's finite
 it's got some it's a bit like having the the temperature of space raised to youknow some background temperature and
 it's that energy that gives mass to the particles so the reason that electronsand quarks have mass is through the
 interaction with this energy that's stored in the Higgs field now it turnsout that the precise value this energy
 has has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe where interestingstuff can happen so if you push the
 higgs field down it has a tendency to collapse to what there's a tenon if youdo you're sort of naive calculations
 they're basically two possible likely configurations for the Higgs field whichis either it's zero everywhere in which
 case you have a universe which is just particles with no mass that can't formatoms and just fly by at the speed of
 light or it explodes to an enormous value what we call the Planck scalewhich is the scale of quantum gravity
 and at that point if the Hicksville was that strong even an electron wouldbecome so massive that it would collapse
 into a black hole and then you have a universe made of black holes and nothinglike us so it seems that the the
 strength of the Higgs field is - it could achieve the value that we seerequires what we call fine-tuning of the
 laws of physics you have to fiddle around with the other fields in thestandard model and their properties to
 just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value that allows atoms toexist this is deeply fishy people really
 dislike this well yeah I guess well so

0:45:57
Speaker 1 :what would be a so - two explanations
 one there's a god the design this perfectly and two is there's an infinitenumber of alternate universes and we'll
 just happen to being the one in which life is possibleyeah complexity so when you say I mean
 life any kind of complexity that's not either complete chaos or black holes

0:46:20
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah I mean how does that make you


0:46:20
Speaker 1 :feel what do you make that has such a
 fascinating notion that this perfectly tuned field that's the same everywhereyeah is there what do you make of that
 yeah well you make of that I mean yeah

0:46:34
Speaker 0 :you like that two of the possible
 explanations yeah I mean well someone you know some cosmic creator way yeahlet's fix that to be at the right level
 that's more possibility I guess it's not a scientifically test for one but youknow theoretically I guess it's possible


0:46:48
Speaker 1 :sorry to interrupt but there could also
 be not a designer but could never be just I guess I'm not sure what thatwould be but as some kind of force that
 that some kind of mechanism by which this this this kind of field is enforcedin order to create complexity basic
 basically forces that pull the universe towards an interesting complexity I mean

0:47:19
Speaker 0 :yeah I mean I has those ideas I don't
 really subscribe to them as I'm saying

0:47:23
Speaker 1 :it sounds really stupid no I mean yeah


0:47:25
Speaker 0 :and there are definitely people that
 make those kind of arguments you know there's ideas that I think it's LiseMullins idea one I think that you know
 universes are born inside black holes and so universe is that behaved likeDarwinian evolution of the universe
 where universes give birth to other universes and they've universes whereblack holes can form are more likely to
 give birth to more universes so you end up with universes which have similarlaws I mean I don't whatever but why I


0:47:52
Speaker 1 :talked to dr. Lee recently understand
 this podcast and he's he's a reminder to me that the physics community has likeso many interesting characters yeah it's
 fascinating yeah anyway so so I mean as

0:48:08
Speaker 0 :an experimentalist I tend to sort of
 think these are interesting ideas but they're not really testable so I tendnot to think about very much
 so I mean going back to the science of this there wasn't that there is anexplanation there is a possible solution
 to this problem of the Higgs which doesn't involve multiverses or creatorsfiddling
 about were the laws of physics if the most popular solution was somethingcalled supersymmetry which is a theory
 which is involves a new type of symmetry of the universe in fact it's one of thelast types of symmetries that is
 possible to have that we haven't already seen in nature which is a symmetrybetween force particles and matter
 particles so what we call fermions which held before the matter particles andbosons which were force particles and if
 you have supersymmetry then there is a superpartner for every particle in thestandard model and the without going to
 the details the effect of this basically is that you have a whole bunch of otherfields and these fields cancel out the
 effect of the standard model fields and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nicesensible value so in supersymmetry you
 naturally without any concurring about with the constants of nature or anythingyou get a Higgs field with a nice value
 which is the one we see so this is one of the written supersymmetry has alsogot lots of other things going for it it
 predicts the existence of a dark matter particle which would be great it youknow it potentially in suggests that the
 the strong force and the electroweak force unify high energy so lots ofreasons people thought this was a
 productive idea and when the LHC was just before it was turned on there was alot of hype I guess a lot of an
 expectation that we would discover these super partners because and particularlythe main reason was that if if
 supersymmetry stabilizes the higgs field at this nice Goldilocks value thesesuper particles should have a mass
 around the energy that we're probing at the LHC around the energy of the Higgsso it was kind of thought you discovered
 the Higgs you probably discover superpartners so once you start creating

0:50:03
Speaker 1 :ripples in this fix field you should be
 able to see these kinds of you should be

0:50:09
Speaker 0 :yeah super fields would be there but I
 said well at the very beginning I said we're probing the vacuum what I mean isreally that you know okay let's say
 these super fields exist the vacuum contains super fields they're they'rethese super symmetric fields if we hit
 them hard enough we can make them vibrate we see super particles comeflying out that's the sort of that's the
 idea the hope ok that's the whole alone

0:50:29
Speaker 1 :but we haven't but we haven't so so far


0:50:30
Speaker 0 :at least I mean we've had now a decade
 of data taking at the LHC no signs of superpartners havesupersymmetric particles have been found
 in fact no signs of any physics any new particles beyond the standard model havebeen found so supersymmetry is not the
 only thing that can do this there are other theories that involve additionaldimensions of space or potentially
 involve the Higgs boson being made of smaller things being made of otherparticles that's an interesting you know


0:50:58
Speaker 1 :I haven't heard that before that's
 really that's an issue but could you maybe linger on that like what whatcould be what could Higgs particle be


0:51:08
Speaker 0 :made of well so the the oldest I think
 the original ideas about this was these theories called Technicolor which werebasically like an analogy with the
 strong force so the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state of two verystrongly interacting particles that were
 a bit like quarks so like quarks but I guess higher energy things with a superstrong force so not the strong force but
 a new force that was very strong and the Higgs was a bound state of these theseobjects and the Higgs wouldn't principle
 if that was right would be the first in a series of Technicolor particlesTechnicolor I think not being a theorist
 but it's not biz basically not done very well there's particularly since the LHCfound the Higgs that kind of it rules
 out you know a lot of these Technicolor theories but there are other things thatare a bit like Technicolor so there's a
 theory called partial composite nurse which is an idea that some of mycolleagues that Cambridge have worked on
 which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs is a bound state of some stronglyinteracting particles and that the
 standard model particles themselves the more exotic ones like the top quark arealso sort of mixtures of these composite
 particles so it's a kind of an extension to the standard model which explainsthis problem with the Higgs bosons
 Goldilocks value but also helps us understand we have we're in a situationnow again a bit like the periodic table
 where we have six quarks six leptons in this kind of you can range in this nicetable and there you can see these
 columns where the patterns repeat and you go okay maybe there's somethingdeeper going on here is that you know
 and and so this would potentially be something this partial composite NOStheory could
 Lane sort of enlarged this picture that allows us to see the whole symmetricalpattern and understand what the
 ingredients why do we have wind so one of the big questions in particle physicsis why are there three copies of the
 matter particles so in what we call the first generation which is what we'remade of there's the electron the
 electron neutrino the up quark on the down quark they're the most commonmatter particles in the universe but
 then there are copies of these four particles in the second and the thirdgenerations so things like muons and top
 quarks and other stuff we don't know why we see these patterns we have no ideawhere it comes from so that's another
 big question you know can we find out the deeper order that explains thisparticular tape period table of
 particles that we see is it possible

0:53:36
Speaker 1 :that the the deeper order includes like
 almost a single entity so like something that I guess like string theory dreamsabout is this is this part is this
 essentially the dream is to discover something simple beautiful and unifying

0:53:53
Speaker 0 :yeah I mean that is the dream and it I
 think for some people for a lot of people it still is the dream so there'sa great book by Steven Weinberg who is
 one of the theoretical physicists who was instrumental in building thestandard model so he came up with some
 others with the electroweak theory the theory that unified electromagnetism andthe weak force and here at this book I
 think it was towards the end of the 80s early 90s called dreams of a finaltheory which is a very lovely quite
 short book about this idea of a final unifying theory that brings everythingtogether and I think you get a sense
 reading his book written at the end of 80s and early 90s that there was thisfeeling that such a theory was coming
 and that was the time when string theory had been was was very exciting so stringtheory there's been this thing called
 the superstring revolution and theoretical physical very excited theydiscovered these theoretical objects
 these little vibrating loops of string that in principle not only was a quantumtheory of gravity but could explain all
 the particles in the standard model and bring it all together and you as you sayyou have one object the string and you
 can pluck it and the way it vibrates gives you these different notes each ofwhich is a different part
 so it's a very lovely idea but the problem is that well there's a there's afew people discover their mathematics is
 very difficult so people have spent three decades and more trying tounderstand string theory and I think you
 know if you spoke to most string theorists they would probably freelyadmit that no one really knows what
 string theory is yet I mean there's been a lot of work but it's not reallyunderstood and the other problem is that
 string theory mostly makes predictions about physics that occurs energies farbeyond what we will ever be able to
 probe in the laboratory yeah probably

0:55:42
Speaker 1 :ever by the way so sorry they take a
 million tangents but is there room for complete innovation of how to build aparticle collider that could give us an
 order of magnitude increase in any kind of energies or do we need to keep justincreasing the size of thing


0:55:58
Speaker 0 :I mean maybe yeah I mean there are ideas
 but to give you a sense of the Gulf that has to be bridgedso the LHC collides particles at an
 energy of what we call fourteen terror electron volts so that's basicallyequivalent of you accelerated a proton
 through 14 trillion volts that gets us to the energies where the Higgs andthese weak particles live they're very
 massive the the scale where strings become manifest is something called thePlanck scale which i think is of the
 order 10 to the hang on again that's right is 10 to the 18 Giga electron voltso about 10 to the 15 terror electron
 volts so you're talking you know trillions of times more energy more the

0:56:45
Speaker 1 :10 to the 15 the 10 to the 14th larger


0:56:49
Speaker 0 :it's a very big number so you know we're
 not talking just an order of magnitude increase in energy we're talking 14orders of magnitude energy increase so
 to give you a sense of what that would look like were you to build a particleaccelerator with today's technology


0:57:04
Speaker 1 :bigger or smaller and then our solar
 system as start the size of the galaxy

0:57:07
Speaker 0 :the galaxy so you need to put a particle
 accelerator that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies where you wouldsee strings if they exist so there's a
 fundamental or problem which is that most of thepredictions of the unified these unified
 theories of quantum theories of gravity only make statements that are testableare energies that we will not be able to
 probe let and barring some unbelievable you know completely unexpectedtechnological or scientific breakthrough
 which is almost impossible to imagine you never never say never but it seemsvery unlikely yeah I can just see the


0:57:43
Speaker 1 :news story Elon Musk decides to build a
 particle collider the size of our it

0:57:50
Speaker 0 :would have to be we'd have to get
 together with all our galactic neighbors to pay for everything

0:57:55
Speaker 1 :what is the exciting possibilities of
 the Large Hadron Collider what is there to be discovered in this in this orderof magnitude of scale is there other
 bigger efforts on the horizon big in this space what are the open problemsthe exciting possibilities you mentioned
 supersymmetry yeah so well there are

0:58:14
Speaker 0 :lots of new ideas well there's lots of
 problems that we're facing so there's a problem with the Higgs field whichsupersymmetry was supposed to solve
 there's the fact that 95% of the universe we know from cosmologyastrophysics is invisible that it's made
 of dark matter and dark energy which are really just words for things that wedon't know what they are it's what
 Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown we know we don't know what they are well

0:58:40
Speaker 1 :that's it's better than an unknown
 unknown yeah well there may be some

0:58:42
Speaker 0 :unknown unknown but I don't know what


0:58:47
Speaker 1 :those yeah but but the the hope is the
 particle accelerator could help us make sense of dark energy dark matter there'sstill there's just some hope for that


0:58:57
Speaker 0 :there's hope for that yes so one of the
 hopes is the LHC could produce a Dark Matter particle in its collisions andyou know it may be that the LHC will
 still discover new particles that it might still supersymmetry could still bethere we just it's just maybe more
 difficult to find than we thought originally and and you know dark matterparticles might be being produced but
 we're just not looking in the right part of the data for them that that'spossible it might be that we need more
 data that these processes are very rare and we need to collect lots and lots ofdata before we see them but I think a
 lot of people would say now that the chances of the LHCdirectly discovering new particles in
 the near future is quite slim it may be that we need a decade more data beforewe can see something or we may not see
 anything that's the that's what we are so I mean the the physics theexperiments that I work on so I work on
 a detector called LHC B which is one of these four big detectors that are spacedaround the ring and we do slightly
 different stuff to the big guys there's two big experiments called outlets andCMS three thousand physicists and
 scientists and computer scientists on them each they are the ones thatdiscovered the Higgs then they look for
 supersymmetry and dark matter and so on what we look at our standard modelparticles called B quarks which
 depending on your preference is either bottom or beauty we tend to say beautybecause it sounds sexier yeah but these
 particles are interesting because they of you can make lots of them we makebillions or Billy a hundreds of billions
 of these things you can therefore measure their properties very preciselyso you can make these really lovely
 precision measurements and what we are doing really is a sort of complementarything to the other big experiments which
 is they if you think the self analogy that I often use is if you imagineyou're looking in you're in a jungle and
 you're looking for an elephant same and you are a hunter and you're kind of likethey said there's the relevance very
 rare you don't know where in the jungle the jungles big so there's two ways yougo about this either you can go out
 wandering around the jungle and try and find the elephant the problem is if theelephant there's only one elephant the
 jungles big the chances of running into it very small or you could look on theground and see if you see footprints
 left by the elephant and if the elephant's moving around you've got achance that you're better chance maybe
 of seeing the elephant's footprints if you see the footprints you go okaythere's an elephant maybe don't know
 what kind of elephant it is but I got a sense there's something out there sothat's sort of what we do we are the
 footprint people we are we're looking for the footprint the impressions thatquantum fields that we haven't managed
 to directly create the particle of the effects these quantum fields have on theordinary standard model fields that we
 already know about so these these be particles the way they behave can beinfluenced by the presence of say super
 fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like and they're the way they decayand
 hey've can be altered slightly from what our theory tells us they ought to behave

1:01:52
Speaker 1 :sure and it's easier to collect huge
 amounts of data and B and B quarks we

1:01:56
Speaker 0 :get you know billions and billions of
 these things you can make very precise measurements and the only place reallyat the LHC or in really in high-energy
 physics at the moment where there's fairly compelling evidence that theremight be something beyond the standard
 model is in these be these beauty quarks

1:02:15
Speaker 1 :decays just to clarify which is the
 difference between the different the four experiments for example theemission is it the kind of particles
 that are being collided is it the energies that were which there collidedwhat's the fundamental difference
 different experiments the collisions are

1:02:30
Speaker 0 :the same what's different is the design
 of the detectors so Atlas and CMS are called they're called what are calledgeneral purpose detectors and they are
 basically barrel shaped machines and the collisions happen in the middle of thebarrel and the barrel captures all the
 particles that go flying out in every direction so in a sphere effectivelythey can flying out and it can record
 all of those particles and what's the

1:02:53
Speaker 1 :site of interrupting but what's what's
 the mechanism of the recording oh these

1:02:57
Speaker 0 :detectors if you've seen pictures of
 them the huge like Atlas is 25 meters high in 45 meters long and vast machinesinstruments I guess you to call them
 really they are they're kind of like onionsso they have layers concentric layers of
 detective detectors different sorts of detectors so close into the beam pipeyou have what a record usually made of
 silicon their tracking detectors so they're little made of strips of siliconor pixels of silicon and when a particle
 goes through the silicon it gives a little electrical signal and you getthese dots you know electrical dots
 through your detector which allows you to reconstruct the trajectory of theparticle so that's the middle and then
 the outside of these detectors you have things called calorimeters which measurethe energies of the particles and in
 very edge you have things called muon chambers which basically met these muonparticles which are the heavy version of
 the electron they are there like high-velocity bullets and they can getright to the edge of the detectors if
 you see something at the edge that's a muon so that's broadly how they work and

1:03:54
Speaker 1 :all there's being recorded that's all


1:03:55
Speaker 0 :being fed out to you know computers


1:03:58
Speaker 1 :must be awesome okay so LHCb is


1:04:00
Speaker 0 :different so we because we're looking
 for these B quarks yes B quarks tend to be produced along the beam lines so in acollision the B quark tend to fly sort
 of close to the beam pipe so we built the detector that sort of pyramidcone-shaped basically that just looks in
 one directions we ignore if you have your collision stuff goes everywhere weignore all the stuff over here and going
 off sideways we're just looking in this little region close to the beam pipewhere most of these B quarks are made so


1:04:29
Speaker 1 :is there a different aspect of the
 sensors involved in the collection of the B quark yes Jack thérèse there are

1:04:36
Speaker 0 :some differences so one of the
 differences is that one of the ways you know you've seen a B quark is that Bquarks are actually quite long-lived by
 particle standards so they live for 1.5 trillions of a second which is if you'reif you're a fundamental particle is a
 very long time because you know the Higgs boson I think lives for about atrillionth of a trillionth of a second
 or maybe even less than that so these are quite long-lived things and theywill actually fly a little distance
 before they decay so they will fly you know a few centimeters maybe if you'relucky
 then they'll decay into other stuff so what we need to do in the middle of thedetector you want to be able to see you
 have your place where the protons crash into each other and that produces loadsof particles that come flying out so you
 have loads of lines loads of tracks that point back to that proton collision andthen you're looking for a couple of
 other tracks maybe two or three that point back to a different place this maybe a few centimeters away from the
 proton collision and that's the sign that little B particle has flown a fewcentimeters in decayed somewhere else so
 we need to be able to very accurately resolve the proton collision from the Bparticle decay so we are the middle of
 our detector is very sensitive and it gets very close to the collisions so youhave this really beautiful delicate
 silicon detector that sits I think it's seven mil millimeters from the beam andthe LHC beam has as much energy as a
 jumbo jet takeoff so it's enough to melt a ton of copper and as you have thisfuriously powerful thing sitting next
 it's tiny delicate you know sense of the consent sirso that into those aspects of our
 detector that are specialized to desert to discover these particular B quarksthat were interested in and is there


1:06:11
Speaker 1 :I mean I remember seeing somewhere that
 there's some mention of matter and antimatter connected to the be the thesebeautiful quarks who's that
 what what's the connection wha yeah what's the connection there yes

1:06:26
Speaker 0 :there is a connection which is that when
 you produce these B particles it'll be these particles consider to theB quark you see the thing that B quark
 is inside so they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles where theB quark is joined together with another
 quark or two maybe two other clocks depending on what it is there aparticular set of these B particles that
 exhibit this property called oscillation so if you make her for the sake ofargument a matter version of one of
 these B particles as it travels because of the magic of quantum mechanics itoscillates backwards and forwards
 between its matter and antimatter versions so just this weird flippingabout backwards and forwards and what we
 can use this for is a laboratory for testing the symmetry between matter andantimatter so if the if the symmetry but
 transparency is precise its exact then we should see these B particles decayingas often as matter as they do as
 antimatter because this oscillation should be even it should spend much timein each state but what we actually see
 is that one of the states it spends more time and it's more likely to decay inone state than the other so this gives
 us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter

1:07:39
Speaker 1 :so what can you sort of return the the
 question or before about this fundamental symmetry it seems like ifthis perfect symmetry between matter and
 antimatter if the equal amount of each in our universe it would just destroyitself
 mm-hm and just like you mentioned we seem to live in a very unlikely universewhere it it doesn't destroy itself
 yeah so do you have some intuition about about why that is I mean well I I'm not

1:08:07
Speaker 0 :a theory I don't have any particular
 ideas myself I mean I sort of do measurements to try and test thesethings but I mean it's in terms of the
 basic problem is that in the Big Bang if you use the standard model to figure outwhat ought to have happened you should
 have got equal amounts of matter antimatter made because whenever youmake a particle in our collide
 collisions for exam but when we collide stuff together youmake a particle you make an antiparticle
 they always come together they always annihilate together so there's no way ofmaking more matter than antimatter that
 we've discovered so far so that means in the Big Bang you get equal amounts ofmatter antimatter as the universe
 expands and cools down during the Big Bang not very long after the Big Bang Ithink a few seconds off the Big Bang
 you have this event called the great annihilation which is where all theparticles antiparticles smack into each
 other annihilate turn into light mostly andyou end up with a universe later right
 if that was what happened then the universe we live in today would be blackand empty apart from some photons that
 would be it so there's stuff in this there is stuff in the universe itappears to be just made of matter so
 there's this big mystery as to where the how did this happen and there arevarious ideas which all involve sort of
 physics going on in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang so itcould be that one possibility is that
 the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this that there was this event that tookplace in the early universe where the
 higgs field basically switched on it acquired its modern value and when thathappened this caused all the particles
 to acquire mass and the universe basically went through a phasetransition where you had a hot plasma of
 massless particles and then in that plasma it's almost like a gas turninginto droplets of water you get kind of
 these little bubbles forming in the universe where the Higgs field hasacquired its modern value the particles
 have got mass and this phase transition in some models can cause more matterthan antimatter to be produced depending
 on how matter bounces off these bubbles in the early universe so that's one ideathere's other ideas to do with neutrinos
 that there are exotic types of neutrinos that can decay in a biased way to justmatter and not to antimatter so and
 people are trying to test these ideas that's what we're trying to do at LHC Bis there's neutrino experiments planned
 they're trying to do these sorts of things as well so yeah there are ideasbut at the moment no clear evidence for
 which of these ideas might be right so

1:10:23
Speaker 1 :we're talking about some incredible
 ideas by the way never hurt anyone be so eloquent about describing even just astandard model so I'm in awe just
 listening if you're interesting just

1:10:35
Speaker 0 :

1:10:36
Speaker 1 :have having fun enjoying it so
 the yes the theoretical the particle physics is fascinating here to me one ofthe most fascinating things about the
 Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it that a bunch of sort of brilliantpeople that probably have egos got
 together and we collaborate together and countries I guess collaborate togetheryou know for the funds and that
 everything's just collaboration everywhere because you maybe I don'tknow what the right question here to ask
 but almost what's your intuition about how was possible to make this happen andwhat are the lessons we should learn for
 the future of human civilization in terms of our scientific progress becauseit seems like this is a great great
 illustration of us working together to do something big yeah I think it's

1:11:25
Speaker 0 :possibly the best example maybe I can
 think of of international collaboration it isn't for some unpleasant purposebasically you know it's I mean so I I
 when I started out in the field in 2008 I as a new PhD student the LHC wasbasically finished so I didn't have to
 go around asking for money for it or trying to make the case so I have hugeadmiration admiration for the people who
 managed that because this was a project that was first imagined in the 1970s andthe late 70s was when the first
 conversations about the LHC were were mooted and it took two and a halfdecades of campaigning and fundraising
 and persuasion until they started breaking ground and building the thingin the early noughties in 2000 so I mean
 I think the reason just from uh sort of from the point of view of this sort ofscience the scientists there I think the
 reason it works ultimately is that everywhere everyone there is there forthe same reason which is well in
 principle at least they're there because they're interested in the world theywant to find out you know what are the
 basic ingredients of our universe what are the laws of nature and so everyoneis pulling in the same direction of
 course everyone has their own things they're interested in everyone has theirown careers to consider and you know and
 pretend that there isn't also a lot of competitions this is funny thing inthese experiments where your
 collaborators your eight-hundred collaborators in LHC be but you're alsocompetitors because you're academics in
 your various universities and you want to be the one that gets the paper out onthe most
 citing you know new measurements so there's this funny thing where you'rekind of trying to stake out your
 territory while also collaborating and having to work together to make theexperiments work and it does work
 amazingly well actually considering all of that and I think there was actually Ithink McKinsey or one of these big
 management consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try tounderstand how these organizations
 functions they figure it out I don't think they could I mean I think one ofthe things that interests one of the
 other interesting things about these experiments is that their big operationslike say outlets there's 3,000 people
 now there is a person nominally who is the head of Atlas they're called thespokesperson and the spokesperson is
 elected by usually by the collaboration but they have no actual power really Imean they can't fire anyone they're not
 anyone's boss so you know my boss is it prefers the professor a professor atCambridge not the head of my experiments
 the head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really and I mean there's allyou got is independent academics who are
 their own bosses who you know so that somehow it nonetheless by kind ofconsensus and discussion and lots of
 meetings these you know things do happen and it does get done but it's like the

1:14:02
Speaker 1 :Queen hearing you in the UK is the
 spokesperson again so no actual don't

1:14:05
Speaker 0 :elect her know whatever everybody seems


1:14:09
Speaker 1 :to love her I don't know from the at my
 outside perspective yeah but yeah giant egos brilliant people and moving forwarddo you think there's I would pick up one


1:14:22
Speaker 0 :thing you said just that just the
 brilliant people thing cuz I'm not I'm not saying that people aren't great yeahbut I think there is this sort of
 impression that physicists will have to be brilliant or geniuses which is nottrue actually and you know you have to
 be relatively bright for sure but you know a lot of people a lot of the mostsuccessful experimental physicists and
 not necessarily the people with the biggest brains they're the people whoyou know particularly one of the skills
 that's most important in particle physics is the ability to work withothers and to collaborate and exchange
 ideas and also to work hard and it's a sort of often it's more a determinationor a sort of other set of skills is not
 just being you know kind of some great

1:15:01
Speaker 1 :brain very true so in I mean there's
 parallels to that in the machine learning world if you wantedif you want to solve any real-world
 problems which I see is the the particle accelerators essentially a real-worldinstantiation of theoretical physics and
 for that you have to not necessarily be brilliant but be sort of obsessedsystematic rigorous sort of unbel
 stubborn all those kind of qualities that make for a great engineer so thisscience scientist purely speaking the
 practitioner of the scientific method so you're right but nonetheless Timmythat's Timmy has been my dad as a
 physicist I argue with him all the time to me engineering is the highest form ofscience and he thinks that's all
 nonsense that the real work is done by the theory edition so he in fact we havearguments about like people like Elon
 Musk for example because I think his work is quite brilliant but he'sfundamentally not coming up with any
 serious breakthroughs he's just creating in this world implementing I'd likemaking ideas happen and have a huge
 impact to me that is that's the Edison that Timmy is is a brilliant work but tohim it's you know it's messy details
 that somebody will figure out anyway that's it I mean I don't know whether

1:16:25
Speaker 0 :you think there is a actual difference
 in temperament between say a physicist and engineer whether it's just what yougot interested in I don't know I mean
 because you know a lot of what experimental physicists do is to someextent engineering and it's not what I
 do I mostly do data stuff but you know a lot of people would be called electricalengineers but they trained as physicists
 but they learn electrical engineering for example because they were buildingdetectors so there's not such a clear
 divide I think yeah it's interesting I

1:16:53
Speaker 1 :mean there but there does seem to be
 like you work with data there does seem to be a certain like I love datacollection
 there might be an OCD element or something that you're more naturallypredisposed to as opposed to theory like
 I'm not afraid of data I love data and there's a lot of people machine learningcore more like they're they're basically
 afraid of data collection afraid of datasets afraid of all that they justwant to
 stay more than theoretical and they're really good at it space I don't know ifthat's a genetic that's your upbringing
 the way you with it the way you go to school but looking into the future ofLHC and other colliders so there's in
 the in America there's the whatever was called the super there's a lot of super

1:17:38
Speaker 0 :superconducting supercollider is super
 gonna desert roll desert Ron yeah so

1:17:42
Speaker 1 :that was cancelled the construction of
 that yeah which is a sad thing but what do you think is the future of theseefforts will a bigger Collider be built
 will LHC be expanded what do you think

1:18:00
Speaker 0 :well in the near future the LHC is gonna
 get an upgrade so that's pretty much confirmed I think it is confirmed whichis the it's not an energy upgrade it's
 and what we call the luminosity upgrade so basically means increasing their datacollection rates so more collisions per
 second basically because after a few years of data taking you get this law ofdiminishing returns where each year's
 worth of data is a smaller and smaller fraction of the lot you've already gotso to get a real improvement in
 sensitivity you need to increase the data rate by an order of magnitude sothat's what this upgrade is gonna do an
 LHC be at the moment the whole detector is basically being rebuilt to allow itto record data at a much larger rate
 than we could before so that will make her sensitive to whole loads of newprocesses that we weren't able to study
 before and you know I mentioned briefly these anomalies anomalies that we'veseen so we've seen a bunch of very
 intriguing anomalies in these B quark decays which may be hinting at the firstsigns of this kind of the elephant you
 know that the the size of some new quantum field or fields may be beyondthe standard model it's not yet at the
 statistical threshold where you can say that you've observed something butthere's lots of anomalies in many
 measurements that all seem to be consistent with each other so it's quiteinteresting so you know the upgrade will
 allow us to really homed in on these things and see whether these alumni'sare real because if they are real and it
 kind of connects to your point about the next generation of machines what wewould have seen then is you know we will
 have seen the tail end of some quantum field in influencing these big quarkswhat we then need to do
 build a bigger Collider to actually make the the particle of that field so ifthese are if these things really do
 exist so that would be one argument I mean Imean so at the moment Europe has going
 through this process of thinking about the strategy for the future so there area number of different proposals on the
 table one is for sort of higher energy upgrade at the LHC where you just buildmore powerful magnets and put them in
 the same tunnel that's a sort of cheap cheaper less ambitious possibility mostpeople don't really like it because it's
 sort of a bit of a dead end because once you've done that there's nowhere to gowell there's a machine called clique
 which is a compact linear collider which is a electron positron Collider that'suses a novel type of acceleration
 technology to accelerate at shorter distances we're still talking kilometerslong but not like 100 kilometers long
 and then the probably the project that is I think getting the most supportit'll be interested to see what happens
 something called the future circular Collider which is a really ambitiouslong-term multi-decade project to build
 a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel under the Geneva region the LHC wouldbecome a kind of feeding machine it
 would just feed for the same area so

1:20:41
Speaker 1 :there would be a theater for there yeah


1:20:44
Speaker 0 :so it kind of the edge machine would be
 where the LHC is but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva and round to the Alpsbasically since you know up to the edge
 of the Geneva base and so basically biggest it's the biggest tunnel you canfit in the region based on the geology
 alarm yes it's big it'd be a long drive if your animal experiments on one sideyou got to go back to CERN for lunch so
 that would be a pain but you know so this project is in principle is actuallyto accelerators the first thing you
 would do is put an electron-positron machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel tostudy the Higgs so you'd make lots of
 Higgs boson study it really precisely in the hope that you see it misbehaving anddoing something it's not supposed to and
 then in the much longer term a hundred with that machine gets taken out you putin a proton proton machine so it's like
 the LHC but much bigger and that's the way you start going and looking for darkmatter or you're trying to recreate this
 a phase transition that I talked about in the early universe but you can seematter antimatter being made for
 examples there's lots of things you can do with these machines the problem isthat they will take you know the most
 optimistic you're not going to have any data from any ofmachines until 2040 or you know because
 they take such a long time to build and they're so expensive so you have W aprocess of R&D design and also the
 political case being made so la seal

1:21:58
Speaker 1 :cost a few billion depends how you count


1:22:01
Speaker 0 :it I think most of the sort of more
 reasonable estimates that take everything into account properly it'saround the sort of 10 11 12 billion euro


1:22:10
Speaker 1 :mark what would be the future sir I
 forgot the numerator future circular

1:22:14
Speaker 0 :Collider future circular because you


1:22:15
Speaker 1 :

1:22:15
Speaker 0 :mean I would call it that when it's
 built because it won't be the future anymore but a very big Hadron Collider Idon't know but yeah that will I know I
 should know the numbers but I think the whole project is estimated at about 30billion euros but that's money spent
 over between now and 2017 probably which is when the last bit of it would be sortof finishing up I guess so you're
 talking a half a century of science coming out of this thingshared by many countries so the actual
 cost the arguments that are made is that you could make this project fit withinthe existing budget of certain if you
 didn't do anything else it's earned by

1:22:58
Speaker 1 :the way we didn't mention what is CERN
 CERN is the European Organization for

1:23:01
Speaker 0 :Nuclear Research as an international
 organization that was established in the 1950s in the wake of the Second WorldWar as a kind of it was sort of like a
 scientific martial plan for Europe the idea was that you bring european scienceback together for peaceful purposes
 because what happened in the 40s was you know a lot of particular scientists buta lot of scientists from Central Europe
 had fled to the United States and Europe and sort of seen his brain drain so it'sa desire to bring the community back
 together for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs but was doingsomething that was curiosity driven so
 and that has continued since then so it's kind of a unique organization it'syou to be a member as a country you sort
 of sign up as a member and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP each yearis a subscription I mean it's a very
 small fraction relatively speaking I think it's like I think the UK'scontribution is 100 or 200 million quid
 or something like that yeah which is quite a lot but no not that's fastest

1:23:57
Speaker 1 :man I mean just the whole thing that is
 possible it's beautiful it's a beautiful idea especially withwhen there's no wars on the line it's
 not like we're freaking out as we're actually legitimately collaborating mmmto do good sighs one of the things I
 don't think we really mentioned is that in the final side that sort of the dataanalysis side is there a break there was
 possible there and the machine learning side like is there is there a lot moresignal to be mined in more effective
 ways from the actual raw data yeah a lot

1:24:25
Speaker 0 :of people are looking into that I mean
 so what we know I use machine learning in my data analysis but pretty knottyyou know basic stuff because I'm not a
 machine learning expert and just a physicist who had to learn to do thisstuff for my day job so what a lot of
 people do is they use kind of off-the-shelf packages that you cantrain to do signal noise you know just


1:24:46
Speaker 1 :like a cleanup yeah but one of the big


1:24:48
Speaker 0 :challenges you know the big challenge of
 the data is a it's volume there's huge amounts of data so the LHC generates nowokay I bought the actual numbers are but
 if you we don't record all our data we record a tiny fraction of the data it'slike of order one ten thousandth or
 something I think right around that so it's it votes mostly gets thrown awayyou couldn't record all the LHC data
 because it would fill up every computer in the world in the matter of daysbasically so there's this process that
 happens on live on the detector something called a trigger which in realtime 40 million times every second has
 to make a decision about whether this collision is likely to contain aninteresting object like a Higgs boson or
 a Dark Matter particle and it has to do that very fast and the softwarealgorithms in the past were quite
 relatively basic you know they did things like measure mementos andenergies of particles and put some
 requirements so you would say if there's a particle with an energy above somethreshold then record this collision but
 if there isn't don't wear as now the attempt is get more and more machinelearning in at the earliest possible
 stage because cool at the stage of

1:25:52
Speaker 1 :deciding whether we want to keep this


1:25:55
Speaker 0 :data or not but also even even maybe
 even lower down than that which is the point where there's this you knowgenerally how the data is reconstructed
 is you start off with a digital a set of digital hits in your detector soScannell saying did you see something do
 you not see something that has to be then turned into tracks particles goingin different directions and that's done
 by using fits that fit through the datapoints and then that's passed to the
 algorithms that then go is this interesting or not what we better is ifyou could train machine learning to look
 at the raw hits the basic real base level information not have any of thereconstruction done and it just goes and
 it can learn to do pattern recognition on this strange three dimensional imagethat you get and potentially that's
 where you could get really big gains because our triggers tend to be quiteinefficient because they don't have time
 to do the full whiz-bang processing to get all the information out that wewould like because you have to do the
 decision very quickly so if you can come up with some clever machine learningtechnique then potentially you can
 massively increase the amount of useful data you record and you know get rid ofmore of the background earlier in the
 process yeah to me that's an exciting

1:26:59
Speaker 1 :possibility because then you don't have
 to build a sort of you can get again without having to have to put an ephod

1:27:08
Speaker 0 :whereas per hardware yeah but I do you
 need you need lots of new GPU farms I guess so hardware it still helps but

1:27:14
Speaker 1 :yeah the you know I got a talk to you so
 if I'm not sure how to ask but you're clearly an incredible sciencecommunicator I don't know if that's the
 right term but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson with aBritish accent
 huh so and you but I mean can you save where we are today actually yeah so

1:27:39
Speaker 0 :today we're in the Royal Institution in
 London which is an old very old organization has been around for abouttwo hundred years now I think maybe even
 I should know when it was founded so the early 19th century it was set up tobasically communicate science the public
 so it was one of the first places in the world where scientists famous scientistswould come and give talks so very
 famously my Humphrey Davy who you may know of who was the person whodiscovered nitrous oxide is a very
 famous chemist and scientists also discovered electronic sis so he used todo these fantastic was very charismatic
 speakers who's to peer here there was a there's a big desk they usually have inthe inner theater and he would do
 demonstrations to the sort of the the folk of London back in the early 19thcentury and Michael Faraday who I talked
 about who is the person who did so much work connection Magnussen he used helectured here he
 did experiments in the basement so this place has got a long history of bothscientific research but also in the
 communication of scientific research so

1:28:36
Speaker 1 :you gave a few lectures here how many -


1:28:39
Speaker 0 :I've give I given you I given a couple
 of lectures in this theater before so I mean that's think so people should

1:28:43
Speaker 1 :definitely go watch online it's there's
 just the explanation of particle physics that all the good thing it's incrediblelike your your lectures are just
 incredible I can't sing it enough pray so it was awesome but maybe can you saywhat did that feel like what was if you
 like to lecture here to talk about that and maybe from a different perspectivemore kind of like how the sausage is
 made is how do you prepare for that kind of thing how do you think aboutcommunication the process of
 communicating these ideas in a way that's inspiring to what I would sayyour talks are inspiring to like the
 general audience you don't actually have to be a scientist you can still beinspired without really knowing much of
 the you you start from the very basics so what's the preparation process andthen the romantic question is what does
 that feel like to perform here I mean

1:29:38
Speaker 0 :profession yeah I mean the process I
 mean the talk that the my favorite talk that I gave here was one called beyondthe Higgs which you can find on the on
 the all institutions youtube channel which you should go and check out I meanand their channels got loads of great
 talks loads of great people as well I mean that one I sort of given a versionof it many times so part of it is just
 practice right I and actually I don't have some great theory of how tocommunicate with people it's more just
 that I'm really interested and excited by those idiot and I like talking aboutthem and through the process of doing
 that I guess I figured out stories that work and explanations that well you see

1:30:10
Speaker 1 :a practice you mean legitimately just
 giving just giving talks given I said I

1:30:14
Speaker 0 :started off you know when I was a PhD
 student doing talks in schools and and I still do that as well some of the timeand doing things I haven't done a bit of
 stand-up comedy which was sort of went reasonably well even if it wasterrifying and that's unusual as well
 there's also a new I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily recommend you check that outI'm gonna post the links several places


1:30:31
Speaker 1 :to make sure people click on it yeah


1:30:35
Speaker 0 :it's basically I kind of have a story in
 my head and I is I you know I kind of I have a think about what I want to say Iusually have some images
 to support what I'm saying and I get up and do it and it's not really I wishthere was some kind of I probably should
 have some proper process this is very sounds like I'm just making up as I goalong and I sort of am I think the


1:30:52
Speaker 1 :fundamental thing they said I think it's
 like I don't know if you know who a guy named Joe Rogan is yes okay so he he'salso kind of sounds like you in a sense
 that he's not very introspective about his process but he's an incrediblyengaging conversationalist and I think
 one of the things that you and him share that I could see is like a genuinecuriosity and passion for the topic I
 think that could be systematically caught you know cultivated I'm surethere's a process to it but you come to
 it naturally somehow I think maybe

1:31:31
Speaker 0 :there's something else as well which is
 to understand something there's this quote by firemen whichever you likewhich is what I cannot create I do not
 understand so like I'm not I'm not like particularly super bright like so for meto understand something I have to break
 it down into its simplest element yes and that you know if and if I can thentell people about that that helps me
 understand it as well so I've actually I've learned I've learned to understandphysics a lot more from the process of
 communication because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas that you'recommunicating in a coffin makes you
 realise you don't really understand the ideas you're talking about and I'mwriting a book at the moment I had this
 experience yesterday where I realized I didn't really understand a prettyfundamental theoretical aspect of my own
 subject and I had to go and hide to sort of spend a couple of days readingtextbooks and thinking about it in order
 to make sure that the explanation I gave captured the got as close to what isactually happening in the theory and to
 do that you have to really understand it properly and yeah and there's layers to

1:32:29
Speaker 1 :understanding yeah it seems like the
 more there must be some kind of Fineman law I mean the the more you the more youunderstand services simply you're able
 to really convey the you know the the essence of the idea right so it's justlike this reverse the reverse effect
 there's like the more you understand the simpler the final thing that youactually convey
 and so the more accessible somehow it becomes that's why faint fineman'slectures are really accessible it was
 just counterintuitive yeah although

1:33:05
Speaker 0 :there are some ideas that are very
 difficult to explain no matter how well or badly youunderstand like I still can't really
 properly explain the Higgs mechanism yeah with because some of these ideasonly exist in mathematics really and the
 only way to really develop an understanding is to go unfortunately toa graduate degree in physics but you can
 get kind of a flavor of what's happening I think and is trying to do that in away that isn't misleading but always
 also intelligible so let me ask them the

1:33:37
Speaker 1 :romantic question of what to you is the
 most perhaps an unfair question what is the most beautiful idea in physics onethat fills you with are is the most
 surprising the strangest the weirdest there's some a lot of differentdefinitions of beauty mmm-hmm and I'm
 sure there's several for you but is there something just jumps to mind thatyou think is just especially I mean I


1:34:05
Speaker 0 :well beautiful there's a specific thing
 in a more general thing so maybe the specific thing a first widget is a conei first came across this as an
 undergraduate i found this amazing so this idea that the forces of natureelectromagnetism strong force the weak
 force they arise in our theories has there a consequence of symmetries sosymmetry is in the laws of nature in the
 equations essentially that used to describe these ideas the process wherebytheories come up with these sorts of
 models as they say imagine the universe obeys thisparticular type of symmetry is a
 symmetry that isn't so far removed from a geometrical symmetry like therotations of a cube it's not you can't
 think of it quite that way but it's sort of a similar sort of idea and you sayokay if the universe respects the
 symmetry you find that you have to introduce a force which has theproperties of electromagnetism or
 different symmetry you get the strong force or a different symmetry you getthe weak force so these interactions
 seem to come from some deeper it suggests that they come from some deepersymmetry principle I mean depends a bit
 how you look at it cuz it could be that we were actuallyjust recognizing symmetries in fact as
 you see but there's something rather lovely about that but I mean I suppose abigger thing that makes me wonder is
 actually if you look at the laws of nature how particles interacts when youget really close down they're basically
 pretty simple things they bounce off each other by exchanging you knowthrough force fields and they move
 around in very simple ways and somehow these basic ingredients these fewparticles that we know about and the
 forces creates this universe which is unbelievably complicated and has thingslike you and me in it and you know the
 earth and stars that make matter in there caused by this from thegravitational energy of their own bulk
 that then gets sprayed into the universe that forms other things I mean the factthat there's this incredibly long story
 that goes right back to you know the big it we can we can take the story rightback to you know a trillionth of a
 second after the Big Bang we can trace the origins of the stuff that we're madefrom and it altum Utley comes from these
 simple ingredients with these simple rules and the fact you can generate suchcomplexity from that is really
 mysterious I think and strange and it's not even a question that physicists canreally tackle because we are sort of
 trying to find these really elementary laws but it turns out that going fromelementary laws and a few particles to
 something even as complicated as a molecule becomes very difficult and sogoing from a molecule to a human being
 is a problem that just you know can't be can't be tackled at least not at themoment


1:36:34
Speaker 1 :so yeah the emergence of complexity from
 simple rules is so beautiful and so mysterious and there's not either wedon't have good mathematics to even try
 to approach that emergent phenomena

1:36:47
Speaker 0 :that's why we have chemistry and biology
 and other subjects as well yeah I don't

1:36:52
Speaker 1 :think I don't think there's a better way
 to end it Harry I can't I mean I think I speak for a lot of people that can'twait to see what happens in the next 5
 10 20 years with you I think you're one of the great communicators of our timeso I hope you continue that and I hope
 that grows and um definitely a huge fan so it was an honorto talk to you today thank someone on it

 particle in our bodies is a survivor from an almighty shootout between matterand antimatter that happened a little
 after the Big Bang in fact only one in a billion particles created at thebeginning of time have survived to the
 present day thank you for listening and
