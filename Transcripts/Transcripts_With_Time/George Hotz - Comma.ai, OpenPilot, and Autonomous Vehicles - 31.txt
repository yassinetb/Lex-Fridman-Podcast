Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 George Hotz he's the founder of comma AI a machine learning based vehicleautomation company he is most certainly
 an outspoken personality in the field of AI and technology in general he firstgained recognition for being the first
 person to carry or unlock an iPhone and since then he's done quite a fewinteresting things at the intersection
 of hardware and software this is the artificial intelligence podcast if youenjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it
 five stars on iTunes supported on patreon or simply connect with me onTwitter at lex friedman spelled fri d-m
 a.m. and i'd like to give a special thank you to Jennifer from Canada forher support of the podcast on patreon
 merci beaucoup Jennifer she's been a friend and an engineering colleague formany years since I was in grad school
 your support means a lot and inspires me to keep this series going and now here'smy conversation with George Hotz do you


0:01:04
Speaker 0 :think we're living in a simulation
 yes but it may be unfalsifiable what do

0:01:09
Speaker 1 :you mean by unfalsifiable so if the


0:01:11
Speaker 0 :simulation is designed in such a way
 that they did like a formal proof to show that no information can get in andout and if their hardware is designed to
 for the anything in the simulation to always keep the hardware in spec it maybe impossible to prove whether we're in
 a simulation or not

0:01:31
Speaker 1 :so they've designed it such there's the
 closed system you can't get outside of the system

0:01:37
Speaker 0 :well maybe it's one of three worlds
 we're either in a simulation which can be exploited we're in a simulation whichnot only can't be exploited but like the
 same things too about VMs I'm a really well-designed VM you can't even detectif you're in a VM or not that's


0:01:50
Speaker 1 :brilliant
 so where it's yeah so the simulation is running in a virtual machine but now in

0:01:56
Speaker 0 :reality all VMs have wasted the fact


0:01:58
Speaker 1 :that's the point I mean is it
 yeah you've done quite a bit of hacking yourself and so you should know thatreally any complicated system will have


0:02:10
Speaker 0 :ways in and out so this isn't
 necessarily true going forward I spent my time away from comma I learned [ __ ]and said dependently typed like it's a
 language for writing math proofs and if you write code that compiles in alanguage like that
 it is correct by definition the types check it's correct and so it's possiblethat the simulation is written in a
 language like this in which case yeah

0:02:39
Speaker 1 :yeah but that can't be sufficiently
 expressive a language like that all weekend it can be yeah okay well so all

0:02:48
Speaker 0 :right so the simulation doesn't have to
 be tiring complete if it has a scheduled end date looks like it does actually

0:02:54
Speaker 1 :with entropy and you know I don't think
 that a simulation that results in something as complicated in universewould have a formal proof of correctness
 right as as possible of course we have

0:03:09
Speaker 0 :no idea how good their tooling is and we
 have no idea how complicated the universe computer really is it may be

0:03:17
Speaker 1 :quite simple it's just very large right


0:03:18
Speaker 0 :it's very it's definitely very large but


0:03:21
Speaker 1 :the fundamental rules might be super


0:03:24
Speaker 0 :simple yeah Conway's gonna live kind of


0:03:27
Speaker 1 :stuff right so if you could hack it so
 imagine the simulation that is hackable if you could hack it what would youchange about the you know like how would
 you approach hacking a simulation the

0:03:41
Speaker 0 :

0:03:43
Speaker 1 :reason I gave that talk I by the way I'm
 not familiar with the talk he gave I just read that you talked about escapingthe simulation yeah like that so maybe
 you can tell me a little bit about the theme and the message there - it wasn't

0:03:54
Speaker 0 :a very practical talk about how to
 actually escape a simulation it was more about a way of restructuring anus-versus-them narrative if we continue
 on the path we're going with technology I think we're in big troublelike as a species and not just as a
 species but even as me as an individual member of the species so if we couldchange rhetoric to be more like to think
 upwards like to think about that we're in a simulation and how we could get outalready we'd be on the right path what
 you actually do once you do that while I assume I would have acquired way moreintelligence in the process of doing
 that so I'll just ask that so the the

0:04:39
Speaker 1 :thinking upwards what kind of ideas what
 kind of breakthrough ideas do you think thinking in that way could inspire andwhat did you say upwards upwards into
 space are you thinking sort of exploration in all forms the space

0:04:54
Speaker 0 :narrative that held for the modernist
 generation doesn't hold as well for the postmodern generation

0:05:03
Speaker 1 :what's the space narrator we're talking
 about the same space the dimensional

0:05:07
Speaker 0 :space like going a little ace is like
 building like yuan mosque like we're gonna build rockets we're gonna go toMars we're gonna colonize the universe


0:05:12
Speaker 1 :and the narrative your friend was born
 in the Soviet Union you're referring to the race to space the race to space

0:05:18
Speaker 0 :explore okay that was a great modernist
 narrative it doesn't seem to hold the same weightin today's culture I'm hoping for good
 postmodern narratives that replace it so

0:05:31
Speaker 1 :think let's think so you work a lot with
 AI so the eyes one formulation of that narrative there could be also I don'tknow how much you do in VR and they are
 yeah that's another eye I know less about it but every time I play with itand our research is fascinating that
 virtual world are you are you interested in the virtual world I would like to

0:05:51
Speaker 0 :move to a virtual reality in terms of


0:05:54
Speaker 1 :

0:05:55
Speaker 0 :your work
 no I would like to physically move there the apartment I can rent in the cloud isway better in the apartment I can rent


0:06:01
Speaker 1 :in the real world well it's all relative
 isn't it because others will have very nice departments too so you'll beinferior in the virtual world that's not


0:06:08
Speaker 0 :how I view the world right I don't view
 the world I mean it's very like like almost zero-sum issue a to view theworld say like my great apartment isn't
 great because my neighbor has one - no my great apartment is great because likelook at this dishwasher man yeah you
 just touch the dish and it's washed right and that is great in and of itselfif I have the only apartment or if
 everybody had the apartment I don't care

0:06:32
Speaker 1 :so you have fundamental gratitude the
 the world first learned of Geo ha George Hotz in August 2007 maybe before thenbut certainly in August 2007 when you
 were the first person to unlock carry unlock an iPhone how did you get intohacking what was the first system you
 discovered vulnerabilities for and broke

0:06:55
Speaker 0 :into so that was really kind of the
 first thing I had I had a book in in 2006 called grey hat hacking and I guessI realized that if you acquired these
 sort of powers you could control the world but I didn't really know that muchabout computers back then I started with
 electronics the first iPhone hack was physical card work um you had to open itup and pull an address line high and it
 was because I didn't really know about software exploitation I learned that allin the next few years and I got very
 good at it but back then I knew about like how menchips are connected to processors and he


0:07:38
Speaker 1 :knew about software and programming
 he didn't didn't know I'll really see you the view of the world and computerswas physical was the most hard work


0:07:49
Speaker 0 :actually if you read the code that I
 released with that in August 2007 it's atrocious

0:07:55
Speaker 1 :

0:07:56
Speaker 0 :the language was it a C say yes and in a
 broken sort of state machine SC I didn't

0:08:02
Speaker 1 :know how to program man so how did you
 learn to program what was your journey cuz I mean we'lltalk about it you've live streams from
 your programming man this is a chaotic beautiful mess how did you arrive at

0:08:15
Speaker 0 :that years and years of practice I
 interned at Google after the summer after the iPhone unlock and I did acontract for them where I built hardware
 for for Street View and I wrote a software library to interact with it andit was terrible code and for the first
 time I got feedback from people who I respected saying you know like don'twrite code like this now of course just
 getting that feedback is not enough the way that I really got good was I wantedto write this thing like that could
 emulate and then visualize like armed binaries because I wanted to hack theiPhone better and I didn't like that I
 couldn't like see what that I couldn't single step through the processorbecause I had no debugger on there
 especially for the low level things like the boot ROM in the bootloader so Itried to build this tool to do it
 and I built the tool once and it was terrible I built the tool second timesit was terrible
 I built the tool third time this by the time I was at Facebook it was kind ofokay
 and then I built the tool fourth time when I was a Google intern again in 2014and that was the first time I was like
 this is finally usable how do you

0:09:25
Speaker 1 :pronounce this kira-kira yeah
 so it's essentially the most efficient way to visualize the change of state ofthe computer as the program is running
 that's what I mean by debugger yeah it's

0:09:39
Speaker 0 :a timeless debugger so you can rewind
 just as easily as going forward think about if you're using gdb you have toput a watch on a variable if you want to
 see if that variable changes and Kure you can just click on that variable andthen it shows every single time when
 that variable was changed or accessed think about it like get for yourcomputers uh the run lock so there's


0:09:59
Speaker 1 :like a deep log of of the state of the
 computer as the program runs and you can rewind why isn't that maybe it is maybeyou can educate me what isn't that kind
 of debugging used more often ah because

0:10:13
Speaker 0 :the tooling is bad
 well two things one if you're trying to debug chrome chrome is a 200 megabytebinary that runs slowly on desktops so
 that's going to be really hard to use for that but it's really good to use forlike CTFs and for boot roms and for
 small parts of code so it's it's hard if you're trying to debug like massive

0:10:36
Speaker 1 :systems what's the CTF and what's the


0:10:38
Speaker 0 :boot ROM the boot ROM is the first code
 that executes it's the minute you give power to your iPhone okay and CTF werethese competitions that I played capture


0:10:46
Speaker 1 :the flag to capture the flag I was going
 to ask you about that what are those LaVette I watched a couple videos onYouTube those look fascinating what have
 you learned about maybe at the high level of vulnerability of systems from

0:10:58
Speaker 0 :these competitions the like I feel like
 like in the heyday of CTFs you had all of the best security people in the worldchallenging each other and coming up
 with new toy exploitable things over here and then everybody okay who canbreak it and when you break it you get
 like there's like a file on the server called flag and then there's a programrunning listening on a socket that's
 vulnerable so you write an exploit you she'll and then you cat flag and thenyou type the flag into like a web-based
 scoreboard and you get points so the

0:11:29
Speaker 1 :goal is essentially to find an exploit
 in the system that allows you to run shell to run arbitrary code on that

0:11:37
Speaker 0 :system that's one of the categories
 that's like the PO noble category

0:11:41
Speaker 1 :vulnerable


0:11:43
Speaker 0 :yeah horrible it's like you know you
 pwned the program you are it's a program

0:11:49
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah you know for personally I
 apologize I'm gonna I'm gonna say it's because I'm Russian but maybe you can

0:11:59
Speaker 0 :help educate me some video game like
 misspell to own way back in the Mia and

0:12:02
Speaker 1 :there's just I wonder if there's a
 definition I'll have to go to urban dictionary for it okay so what was theheyday seat yeah by the way but was it
 what decade are we talking about I think

0:12:15
Speaker 0 :like I mean maybe I'm biased because
 it's the era that that that I played but like 2011 to 2015 because the modern CTFscene is similar to the modern
 competitive programming scene you have people who like do drills you havepeople who practice and then once you've
 done that you've turned it lesson to a game of generic computer skill and moreinto a game of okay you memorize you you
 drill on these five categories and then before that it wasn't it didn't havelike as much attention as it had I don't
 know they were like I won $30,000 ones in Korea for one of these competitions

0:12:56
Speaker 1 :oh crap they were they were that so that
 means I mean money's money but that means there was probably good peoplethere exactly yeah are the challenges
 human constructive or are they grounded in some real flaws and real systems

0:13:10
Speaker 0 :usually they're human constructed but
 they're usually inspired by real flaws

0:13:14
Speaker 1 :what kind of systems are imagined is
 really focused on mobile like what has vulnerabilities these days is it doesprimarily mobile systems like Android


0:13:24
Speaker 0 :everything does No yeah of course the
 price has kind of gone up because less and less people can find them and what'shappened in security is now if you want
 to like jailbreak an iPhone you don't need one exploit anymore you need nine

0:13:37
Speaker 1 :nine chained together what women yeah
 Wow okay so it's really so what's the but what's the benefit speaking higherlevel philosophically about hacking I
 mean it sounds from everything I've seen about you you just love the challengeand you don't want to do anything you
 don't want to bring that exploit out into the world and doing the actual letit run wild you just want to solve it
 and then you go on to the next thing oh

0:14:04
Speaker 0 :yeah I mean doing criminal stuffs not
 really worth it and I'll actually use the same argument for why I don't dodefense for why I don't do crime
 if you want to defend a system say the system has ten holes right if you findnine of those holes as a defender you
 still lose because the attacker gets in through the last one if you're anattacker you only have to find one out
 of the ten but if you're a criminal if you log on with a VPN nine out of theten times but one time you forget you're


0:14:37
Speaker 1 :done because you're caught okay because


0:14:39
Speaker 0 :you only have to mess up once to be
 caught as a criminal yeah that's why I'm not a criminal

0:14:44
Speaker 1 :but okay let me uh that's having a
 discussion with somebody just at a high level about nuclear weapons actually whywe're having blowing ourselves up yet
 and my feeling is all the smart people in the world look at the distribution ofsmart people smart people are generally
 good and then this other person I was talking to Sean Carroll the physicistand you were saying no good and bad
 people are evenly distributed amongst everybody my sense was good hackers arein general good people and they don't
 want to mess with the world what's your

0:15:21
Speaker 0 :sense I'm not even sure about that like
 I have a nice life crime wouldn't get me anythingbut if you're good and you have these
 skills you probably have a nice life too

0:15:38
Speaker 1 :right like you can use the father things
 but is there an ethical is there some is there a little voice in your head thatsays well yeah if you could hack
 something to where you could hurt people

0:15:50
Speaker 0 :

0:15:51
Speaker 1 :and you could earn a lot of money doing
 it though not hurt physically perhaps but disrupt her life in some kind of wayit is there a little voice that says um


0:16:02
Speaker 0 :what two things one I don't really care
 about money so like the money wouldn't be anincentive the thrill might be an
 incentive but when I was 19 I read crime and punishment right that was anotherthat was another great one that talked
 me out of ever really doing crime Oh cuz it's like that's gonna be me I'd getaway with it whatever just went in my
 head even if I got away with it you know and then you do crime for long enoughyou'll never get away with it that's


0:16:28
Speaker 1 :right in the end that's a good reason to


0:16:31
Speaker 0 :be good I wouldn't say good I just say


0:16:34
Speaker 1 :I'm not bad you're a talented programmer
 and a hacker in a good positive sense of the word award you've played aroundfound vulnerabilities in various systems
 what have you learned broadly about the design of systems and so on from that

0:16:51
Speaker 0 :from that whole process you learn to not
 take things for what people say they are but you look at things for what theyactually are


0:17:05
Speaker 1 :

0:17:07
Speaker 0 :yeah I understand that's what you tell


0:17:11
Speaker 1 :me it is but what does it do man and you
 have nice visualization tools to really know what it's really doing oh I wish

0:17:16
Speaker 0 :I'm a better programmer now than I was
 in 2014 I said Kira that was the first tool that I wrote that was usable Iwouldn't say the code was great I still
 wouldn't say my code is great so how was

0:17:28
Speaker 1 :your evolution as a programmer except
 practice he went he started with C at which point did you pick up Pythonbecause you're pretty big and Python


0:17:37
Speaker 0 :though now yeah in uh in college I went
 to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22 um I went back I'm like I'm gonna take allyour hardest CS courses we'll see how I
 do right like did I miss anything by not having a real undergraduate educationtook operating systems compilers AI and
 they're like a freshman reader math course and operating says some of these

0:17:59
Speaker 1 :some of those classes you mentioned


0:18:04
Speaker 0 :actually they're great at least one the
 2012 circuit 2012 operating systems and compilers we're two of the best classesI've ever taken my life because you
 write an operating system and you write a compiler I wrote my operating systemin C and I wrote my compiler in Haskell
 but classical well somehow I picked up Python that semester as well I startedusing it for the CTS actually that's
 when I really started to get into CTF and CTF you're all to race against theclock so I can't write things and say oh


0:18:35
Speaker 1 :there's a clock component so you really
 want to use the programming language you

0:18:39
Speaker 0 :can be fastest than 48 hours pone as
 many of these challenges you can pone yeah you got like a hundred points achallenge whatever team gets the most


0:18:45
Speaker 1 :you were both the Facebook and Google
 for a brief stint yeah well the project zero actually at Google for five monthswhere you develop kara what was project
 zero about in general speak what what just curious about the security effortsin these companies


0:19:05
Speaker 0 :well product zero started the same time
 I I went there what what years are there

0:19:10
Speaker 1 :

0:19:12
Speaker 0 :2015 2015 so that was right at the
 beginning of project it's small it's Google's offensive security team I'lltry to give I'll try to give the best
 public facing explanation that I can so the idea is basically thesevulnerabilities exist in the world
 nation states have them some high powered bad actors have themsometime people will find these
 vulnerabilities and submit them in bug bounties to the companies but a lot ofthe companies don't really care it only
 fix the bug there's no it doesn't hurt for there to be a vulnerability soproject zero is like we're gonna do it
 different we're going to announce a vulnerability and we're going to givethem 90 days to fix it and then whether
 they fix it or not we're gonna drop the drop the zero day oh wow we're gonna

0:20:05
Speaker 1 :drop the weapon that's so cool that is
 so cool I love that deadlines though that's so cool give him real deadlines

0:20:11
Speaker 0 :yeah and I think it's done a lot for
 moving the industry forward I watched

0:20:15
Speaker 1 :your coding sessions on the stream
 downline you code things up basic projects usually from scratch I wouldsay sort of as a programmer myself just
 watching you that you type really fast and your brain works in both brilliantand chaotic ways I don't know if that's
 always true but certainly for the live streams so it's it's interesting to mebecause I'm more I'm much slower and
 systematic and careful and you just move I mean probably an order of magnitudefaster some curious is there a method to
 your madness is this just who you are there's pros

0:20:53
Speaker 0 :and cons there's pros and cons to my
 programming style and I'm aware of them like if you ask me to like like getsomething up and working quickly with
 like an API that's kind of undocumented I will do this super fast because I willthrow things at it until it works if you
 ask me to take a vector and rotate it 90 degrees and then flip it over the XYplane I'll spam program for two hours


0:21:21
Speaker 1 :and won't get it all because it's
 something that you could do with a sheet of paper think through design and thenjust you really just throw stuff at the
 wall and you get so good at it that it

0:21:33
Speaker 0 :usually works I should become better at
 the other kind as well sometimes I'll do things pathetically it's nowhere near asentertaining on the twitch streams I do
 exaggerate it a bit on the edge games as well the twitch streams I mean what doyou want to see a game or you want to
 see actions permit me right I'll show you a PM for programming yes I recommend

0:21:48
Speaker 1 :people go to I think I watched
 I was probably several hours you put like I've actually left you programmingin the background while I was
 programming because you made me you it was it was like watching a really goodgamer
 it's like energizes you because you're like moving so fast it so it's it'sawesome it's inspiring and so it made me
 jealous that like because my own program is inadequate in terms of speed Oh as I

0:22:16
Speaker 0 :was like so I'm twice as frantic on the
 live streams as I am when I code without

0:22:22
Speaker 1 :oh it's super entertaining so I I wasn't
 even paying attention to where you were coding which is great it's just watchingyou switch windows and VAM I guess is


0:22:31
Speaker 0 :driven screen I've developed a workflow
 Facebook and talk about how do you learn

0:22:35
Speaker 1 :new programming tools ideas techniques
 these days what's your like methodology for learning new things so I wrote for

0:22:43
Speaker 0 :comma the distributed file systems out
 in the world are extremely complex like if you want to install something likelike like Saif Saif is I think the like
 open infrastructure to should be a file system or there's like newer ones likeseaweed FS but these are all like 10,000
 plus line projects I think some of them are even 100,000 line and justconfiguring them as a nightmare so I
 wrote I wrote one um it's 200 lines and it's it uses likenginx to the live servers and has low
 master server that I wrote and go and the way I go this if I would say thatI'm proud per line of any code I wrote
 maybe there's some exploits that I think are beautiful and then this this is 200lines and just the way that I thought
 about it I think was very good and the reason it's very good is because thatwas the fourth version of it that I
 wrote and I had three versions that I

0:23:38
Speaker 1 :threw away you mentioned you see go I
 ready go yeah and go so is that a functional language I forget what goes

0:23:45
Speaker 0 :they go is Google's language right I'm a
 functional it's some it's like in a way it's C++ but easier it's it's stronglytyped it has a nice ecosystem erotic
 when I first looked at it I was like this is like Python but it takes twiceas long to do anything yeah
 now that I've open pilot is migrating to sea but it still has large Pythoncomponents I now understand why Python
 doesn't work for large code bases and why you want something like Oh

0:24:15
Speaker 1 :interesting so why why doesn't Python
 work for so even most speaking for myself at least like we do a lot ofstuff basically demo level work with
 autonomous vehicles and most of the work is Python yeah why doesn't Python work

0:24:31
Speaker 0 :for large code bases because well lack
 of type checking is a big errors

0:24:37
Speaker 1 :

0:24:38
Speaker 0 :creeping yeah and like you don't know
 the compiler can tell you like nothing right so everything is either you knowlike like syntax errors fine but if you
 misspell a variable and Python the compiler won't catch that there's likelinters that can catch it some other
 time there's no types this is really thebiggest downside and then will Python
 slow but that's not related to it well maybe the kind of related to its that's

0:25:04
Speaker 1 :lacking so what's what's in your toolbox
 these days is a Python what else go I

0:25:07
Speaker 0 :need to move on something else but my
 adventure interdependently type languages I love these languages theyjust have like syntax from the 80s what


0:25:17
Speaker 1 :do you think about JavaScript
 yes thanks Nick tomorrow typescript

0:25:23
Speaker 0 :javascript is the whole ecosystem is
 unbelievably confusing NPM updates a package from zero to twoto zero to five and that breaks your
 babble linter which translates your es5 into es6 which doesn't run on so why doI have to compile my JavaScript again


0:25:41
Speaker 1 :huh it may be the future though if you
 think about I mean I've embraced JavaScript recently because just likeI've continually embraced PHP it seems
 that these worst possible languages live on for long is that cockroaches never

0:25:58
Speaker 0 :die yeah well it's in the browser and


0:26:00
Speaker 1 :it's fast it's fast yeah it's in the
 browser and compute mites they become you know the browser it's unclear whatthe role the browser's in terms of
 distributed computation in the future so

0:26:12
Speaker 0 :javascript is definitely here to stay


0:26:14
Speaker 1 :yeah interesting if
 Tom's vehicles will run on JavaScript one day I mean you have to considerthese possibilities well all our debug


0:26:21
Speaker 0 :tools are JavaScript
 we actually just open-source them we have a tool Explorer which you canannotate your dis engagements and we
 have tool cabana which lets you analyze the canned traffic from the car so

0:26:32
Speaker 1 :basically any time you're visualizing
 something about the log you using

0:26:37
Speaker 0 :javascript yeah well the web is the best
 UI toolkit by far yeah um so and then you know what you're voting inJavaScript we have a react guy he's good


0:26:44
Speaker 1 :he acts nice let's get into it so let's
 talk to Thomas vehicles you found it comma a let's at a high level how didyou get into the world the vehicle
 automation can you also just for people who don't know tell the story of comma

0:27:01
Speaker 0 :yeah sure so I was working at this AI
 startup and a friend approached me and he's like dude I don't know where thisis going but the coolest applied AI
 problem today is self-driving cars I'm like well absolutely do you want to meetwith UI mosque and he's looking for
 somebody to build a vision system for auto pilot this is when they were stillon ap one they were still using mobile I
 kneel on back then was looking for a replacement and he brought me in and wetalked about a contract where I would
 deliver something that meets mobile eye level performance I would get paidtwelve million dollars if I could
 deliver it tomorrow and I would lose 1 million dollars for every month I didn'tdeliver yeah so I was like ok this is a
 great deal this is a super exciting challenge you know what even if it takesme 10 months I get two million dollars
 it's good maybe I can finish up in five maybe I don't finish it at all and I getpaid nothing and I'll work for twelve


0:28:00
Speaker 1 :months for free so maybe I just take a
 pause on that I'm also curious about this because I've been working onrobotics for a long time and I'm curious
 to see a person like you just step in and sort of somewhat naive but brilliantright so that's though that's the best
 place to be because you basically full-steam take on a problem howconfident how from that time because you
 know a lot more now at that time how hard do you think it is to solve all ofautonomous driving I remember I


0:28:25
Speaker 0 :suggested to Elon in the meeting I'm
 putting GPU behind each camera to keep thecompute local this is an incredibly
 stupid idea I leave the meeting 10 minutes later and I'm like I could havespent a little bit of time thinking
 about this problem was I would just send all your cameras to one big GPU you'remuch better off doing that oh sorry you


0:28:48
Speaker 1 :said behind every camera you have a


0:28:50
Speaker 0 :small GPU I was like oh I'll put the
 first few layers of my comm there Oh like why did I say that that's possibleit's possible but it's a bad idea it's


0:28:58
Speaker 1 :not obviously a bad idea pretty obvious


0:29:00
Speaker 0 :but whether it's actually a bad idea or
 not I left that meeting with Elon like beating myself up I'm like why did I say

0:29:06
Speaker 1 :something stupid yeah you haven't given
 I'm at least like thought through every

0:29:12
Speaker 0 :aspect yes he's very sharp too like
 usually in life I get away with saying stupid things and then kind of coursealright right away he called me out
 about it and like usually in life I get away with saying stupid things and thenlike people will you know people a lot
 of times people don't even notice and I'll like correct it and bring theconversation back but with Elon it was
 like nope like okay well that's not at all why the contract fell through I wasmuch more prepared the second time I met


0:29:35
Speaker 1 :him yeah but in general huh how hard did
 you think it is like 12 months is uh-oh is it tough timeline oh I just thought

0:29:43
Speaker 0 :I'd clone mob like you three I didn't
 think I'd solve level five self-driving

0:29:48
Speaker 1 :or anything so the goal there was to do
 lane-keeping good good link keeping I

0:29:52
Speaker 0 :saw my friend showed me the outputs from
 a mobile I in the office from a mobile I was just basically two lanes at aposition of a lead car mm-hm
 like I can I can gather a dataset and train this net in in weeks and I did

0:30:04
Speaker 1 :well first time I tried the
 implementation of mobile I and the test I was really surprised how good it isit's quite incredibly good because I
 thought it's just because I've done a lot of computation I thought it'd be alot harder to create a system that
 that's stable so I was personally surprised you know have to admit itbecause I was kind of skeptical before
 trying it because I thought it would go in and out a lot more it would getdisengaged a lot more and it's pretty
 robust so what how how hard is the problem we need to when you tackled it

0:30:42
Speaker 0 :I think a p1 was great like Elon talked
 about dis engagements on the 405 down in LA we'd like the lane marks were kind offaded and the mobile eye system would
 drop out uh like I had something up and working that I would say was like thesame quality in three months same


0:31:02
Speaker 1 :quality but how do you know you you say
 stuff like that yeah confidently but you can't and I love it but well thequestion is you can't you're kind of


0:31:13
Speaker 0 :going by feel because he not solely
 absolutely like like I would take I hadn't I borrowed my friends Tesla yeahI would take ap one out for a drive yeah
 and then I would take my system out for

0:31:22
Speaker 1 :a dry and seems reasonably like the same
 so the four or five how hard is it to create something that could actually bea product that's deployed I mean I've
 read an article or you on this respondent said something by you sayingthat to build autopilot is is more
 complicated than a single George Hotz a level job how hard is that job to createsomething that would work across the


0:31:57
Speaker 0 :globe Lee what are the global ease the
 challenge but Elon followed that up by saying it's gonna take two years in acompany of ten people yeah and Here I am
 four years later with a company of twelve people and I think we still have

0:32:09
Speaker 1 :another two to go two years so yeah so
 what do you think what do you think about the hottest is progressing withautopilot v2 v3


0:32:18
Speaker 0 :I think we've kept pace with them pretty
 well I think navigator autopilot is terriblewe had some demo features internally of
 the same stuff and we would test it and I'm like I'm not shipping this even aslike open-source software to people what


0:32:35
Speaker 1 :do you think is do


0:32:36
Speaker 0 :Consumer Reports does a great job of
 describing it like when it makes a lane change it does it worse than a humanyou shouldn't ship things like autopilot
 open pilot they Lane keep better than a human if you turn it on for a stretch ofhighway like an hour long it's never
 gonna touch a lane line human will touch probably a lane line twice you just

0:32:58
Speaker 1 :inspired me I don't know if you're
 grounded and data on that I read labor okay but no but that's interesting uh Iwonder actually how often we touch Lane
 lines in general like a little bit cuz

0:33:12
Speaker 0 :it is okay I could answer that question
 pretty easily with the common data side yeah I'm curious I've never answered itI don't know yeah I just - is like my


0:33:20
Speaker 1 :person it feels right that's interesting
 because every time you touch the lane that's the source of a little bit ofstress and kind of lane-keeping is
 removing that stress that's all to me the big the biggest value-add honestlyis just removing the stress of having to
 stay in lane and I think honestly I don't think people fully realize firstof all that that's a big value add but
 also that that's all it is

0:33:43
Speaker 0 :and that not only I find it a huge value
 add I drove down when we moved to San Diego I drove down our Enterpriserent-a-car and I missed it so I missed
 having the system so much it's so much more tiring to drive without it it's itis that Lane centering that's the key
 feature yeah and in a way it's the only feature thatactually adds value to people's lives
 and autonomous vehicles today way mode does not add value to people's livesit's a more expensive lower slower uber
 maybe someday it'll be this big cliff where it adds value but I don't usually

0:34:19
Speaker 1 :do this vessei I haven't talked to is
 that this is good because I haven't I have intuitively but I think we'remaking it explicit now I I actually
 believe that really good lane-keeping is a reason to buy a car will be a reasonto buy a car is a huge value add I've
 never until we just started talking about it haven't really quite realizedthat that I've felt with elan chase of
 level four is not the correct chase it was on because you should just say Teslahas the best as if from a testing
 perspective say Tesla has the best lane-keeping coming I should say comingI is the best link keeping and that is
 it yeah yeah does do you think well you

0:35:07
Speaker 0 :have to do the longitudinal as well
 you can't just Lane keep you have to do a cc but a cc is much more forgivingthan lanky especially on the highway oh


0:35:17
Speaker 1 :by the way are you uh calming eyes
 camera only correct oh no we use the

0:35:21
Speaker 0 :

0:35:23
Speaker 1 :radar we from the car you were able to


0:35:25
Speaker 0 :get to open it um we can't do a camera
 only now it's gotten to the point but we leave the radar there is like a it's

0:35:33
Speaker 1 :it's fusion now okay so let's maybe talk
 through some of the system specs on the hardware or what it what's what's thehardware side of what you're providing
 what's the capabilities in the software side would open pilot and so on so open

0:35:47
Speaker 0 :pilot as the the box that we sell that
 it runs on it's a phone in a plastic case it's nothing special we sell itwithout the software so you're like you
 know you buy the phone it's just easy it'll be easy setup but it's sold withno software
 open pilot right now is about to be 0.6 when it gets to 1.0 I think we'll beready for a consumer product we're not
 gonna add any new features we're just gonna make the lane-keeping reallyreally good
 so what do we have right now it's a snapdragon 820say so many IMX 298 forward-facing
 camera driver monitoring camera and she's a selfie cam on the phone and acan transceiver biffle's little thing
 calls pandas and they talk over USB to the phone and then they have threecanvases that they talk to the car one
 of those campuses is the radar CANbus one of them is the main car CANbus andthe other one is the proxy camera CANbus
 we leave the existing camera in place so we don't turn a DB off right now westill turn a TV off if you're using our
 longitudinal but we're gonna fix that

0:36:55
Speaker 1 :before 1.0 you got it wow that's cool so
 in its can both way so how are you able to control vehicles so we proxy the

0:37:03
Speaker 0 :vehicles that we work with already have
 Lane Keeping Assist system so Lane Keeping Assist can mean a huge varietyof things it can mean it will apply a
 small torque to the wheel after you've already crossed a lane line by a footwhich is the system in the older Toyotas
 versus like I think Tesla still calls it Lane Keeping Assist where it'll keep youperfectly in the center of the lane on


0:37:31
Speaker 1 :the highway you can control like you
 would in joystick the cars these so these cars already have the capabilityof drive-by-wire so is it is it trivial
 to convert a car that it operates with it open pile is able to control the

0:37:48
Speaker 0 :steering Oh a new car or a car that we
 so we have support now for 45 different makes of cars what are one of the cars

0:37:52
Speaker 1 :

0:37:55
Speaker 0 :general mostly Hondas and Toyotas we
 support almost every Honda and Toyota made this year and then a bunch of GM'sbunch of Subarus which it doesn't have


0:38:04
Speaker 1 :to be like a Prius it could be Coral as


0:38:08
Speaker 0 :well okay the 2020 Corolla is the best
 car with open pilot it just came out there the actuator has less lag than theolder Corolla


0:38:15
Speaker 1 :I think I started watching video with
 your eye the way you make videos is awesome literally the dealerships

0:38:25
Speaker 0 :streaming stream for an hour


0:38:27
Speaker 1 :yeah and basically like if stuff goes a
 little wrong you're just like you just go with it yeah I love it what's realyeah that's real that's that's it's
 that's so beautiful and it's so in contrast to the way other companieswould put together a video like that how
 do I like to do it like good I mean if you become super rich one day issuccessful I hope you keep it that way
 because I think that's actually what people love that kind of genuine oh it's

0:38:54
Speaker 0 :all that has value to me yeah my money
 has no if I sell out to like make money and I sold out it doesn't matter what doI get yacht I don't I got and I think


0:39:04
Speaker 1 :Tesla's actually has a small inkling of
 that as well with autonomy day they did reveal more than I mean of coursethere's marketing communications you can
 tell but it's more than most companies will reveal which is I hope they gotowards a direction more other companies
 GM Ford oh Jessa Tesla's gonna win level

0:39:23
Speaker 0 :5 they really are so let's talk about it


0:39:26
Speaker 1 :you think you're focused on level 2


0:39:32
Speaker 0 :currently currently we're gonna be one
 to two years behind Tesla getting to level five okay we're interested rightwe're into it you're in I'm just saying
 once Tesla gets it we're one to two years behindI'm not making any timeline on when
 Tesla's that's right you did that's brilliantI'm sorry Tesla investors if you think
 you're gonna have an autonomous robot taxi fleet by the end of the year yesthat's all bet against that so that what


0:39:55
Speaker 1 :do you think about this the most level


0:40:00
Speaker 0 :four companies are kind of just doing


0:40:01
Speaker 1 :their usual safety driver during full
 autonomy kind of testing and then Tesla does basically trying to go fromlane-keeping to full autonomy what do
 you think about that approach how successful would it be a ton better

0:40:18
Speaker 0 :approach because Tesla is gathering data
 on a scale that none of them are they're putting real users behind the behind thewheel of the car
 it's I think the only strategy that works the incremental well so there's a

0:40:34
Speaker 1 :few components to test approach that's
 that's more than just incrementally you spoke with is the one is the software soover-the-air software updates necessity


0:40:44
Speaker 0 :I mean way more ease have those - those
 aren't but there was differentiating from the automaker's right no link

0:40:49
Speaker 1 :keeping assist systems have no cars with
 lane keeping system have that except Tesla yeah and the other one is the datathe other direction which is the ability
 to query the data I don't think they're actually collecting as much days peoplethink but the ability to turn on
 collection and turn it off so I'm both in the robotics world in the thepsychology human factors world many
 people believe that level to autonomy is problematic because of the human factorlike the more the task is automated the
 more there's a vigilance decrement you start to fall asleep you start to becomecomplacent start texting more and so on
 do you worry about that because if we're talking abouttransition from lane-keeping to full
 autonomy if you're spending eighty percent of the time not supervisingmachine do you worry about what that
 means to the safety of the drivers one

0:41:46
Speaker 0 :we don't consider open pilot to be 1.0
 until we have 100% driver monitoring you you can cheat right now our drivermonitoring system there's a few ways to
 cheat it there pretty obvious we're working on making that better before weship a consumer product that can drive
 cars I want to make sure that I have driver monitoring that you can't cheat

0:42:05
Speaker 1 :what's like a successful driver
 monitoring system look like it's keep its is it all buzz just keeping your

0:42:11
Speaker 0 :eyes on the road um well a few things so
 that's what we went with it first for driver monitoring I'm checking I'mactually looking at where your head is
 looking but cameras know about my resolution eyes are a little bit hard to

0:42:21
Speaker 1 :get well head is this big I mean that is


0:42:23
Speaker 0 :good and actually a lot of it just as
 psychology wise to have that monitor constantly there it reminds you that youhave to be paying attention but we want
 to go further we just hired someone full-time to come onto the drivermonitoring I want to detect phone in
 frame and I want to make sure you're not sleeping

0:42:42
Speaker 1 :how much does the camera see of the body


0:42:45
Speaker 0 :this one not enough not enough the next
 one everything

0:42:49
Speaker 1 :what's interesting fish Atkins we have
 we're doing just data collection that real-time but fish eye is a beautifulmouth being able to capture the body and
 the smartphone is really like the biggest problem I'll show you I can show

0:43:03
Speaker 0 :you one of the pictures from from our
 finder system

0:43:06
Speaker 1 :awesome so you're basically saying the
 driver monitoring will be the answer to

0:43:13
Speaker 0 :that um I think the other point that the
 original paper is is good as well you're not asking a human to supervise amachine without giving them meat they
 can take over at a time right our safety model you can take over we disengage onboth the gas or the brake we don't
 disengage on steering I don't feel you have to but we disengage on gas or brakeso it's very easy for you to take over
 and it's very easy for you to re-engage that switching should be super cheapyeah the cars that require even
 autopilot requires a double press that's almost I said I like that yeah and thenthen the cancel um to cancel in
 autopilot you either have to press cancel which no one knows where that isso they press the brake but a lot of
 things you don't you want to press the brake you want present assso you should cancel on gas or wiggle
 the steering wheel which is bad as well

0:43:57
Speaker 1 :wow that's brilliant I haven't heard
 anyone articulate at that point I like

0:44:01
Speaker 0 :what this is all I think about


0:44:03
Speaker 1 :it's because I think I think actually
 Tesla has done a better job than most automakers at making that frictionlessbut you just described that it could be


0:44:16
Speaker 0 :even better I love super cruise as an
 experience once it's engaged yeah I don't know if you've used it but gettingthe thing to try to engage him yeah I've


0:44:23
Speaker 1 :used this of Germany's super cruise a
 lot so what's their thoughts on the super Cruiser system in June disengage

0:44:30
Speaker 0 :super cruise and it falls back to ACC so
 my car's like still accelerating it feels weird otherwise when you actuallyhave super cruise engaged on the highway
 it is phenomenal we bought that Cadillac we just sold it but we bought it just tolike experience this and I wanted
 everyone in the office to be like this is what we're striving to build GMpioneering with the driver monitoring


0:44:52
Speaker 1 :you know you like their driver


0:44:54
Speaker 0 :monitoring system it has some bugs
 if there's a sun shining back year it'll be blind to you by overall mostly yeah

0:45:03
Speaker 1 :that's so cool you know the stuff that's
 uh I don't often talk to people that because it's such a rare carunfortunately they bought one yes


0:45:10
Speaker 0 :possibly for us we lost like by 25k the
 deprecation but a Philips worth it

0:45:16
Speaker 1 :I was very pleasantly surprised that GM
 system was so innovative and really that wasn't advertised much wasn't talkedabout much yeah and I was nervous that
 it would die that they would disappear

0:45:31
Speaker 0 :my eyes did they put it on the wrong car
 they should've put it on the bolt and not some weird Cadillac that nobody

0:45:36
Speaker 1 :bought I think that's gonna be into
 they're saying at least is going to be into their entire fleet so what do youthink about it if as long as we're on
 the driver monitoring what do you think about you know I must claim that drivermonitoring is not needed normally I love


0:45:51
Speaker 0 :his claims that one is stupid
 that one is stupid and you know he's not gonna have his level five fleet by theend of the year hopefully he's like okay
 I was wrong I'm gonna add driver monitoring because when these systemsget to the point that they're only
 messing up once every thousand miles you absolutely need driver monitor so

0:46:13
Speaker 1 :let me play Delta because I agree with
 you but let me play devil's advocate so one possibility is that without drivermonitoring people are able to monitor
 the self-regulate monitor themselves you know that so your idea is seeing all the

0:46:30
Speaker 0 :people sleeping in decimals uh yeah well


0:46:33
Speaker 1 :I'm a little skeptical of all the people
 sleeping in Tesla's because I have I've stopped paying attention to that kind ofstuff because I want to see real data
 there's too much glorified it doesn't feel scientific to me so I want to knowyou know what how many people are really
 sleeping in Tesla's vs. sleeping I've I was driving here sleep-deprived in a carwith no automation I was falling asleep


0:47:01
Speaker 0 :I agree that it's high P it's just like
 you know what if you under I've am wondering I think I rented a my lastautopilot experience was I rented a
 model three in march and drove it around thewheel thing is annoying and the reason
 the wheel thing is annoying we use the wheel thing as well but we don'tdisengage on wheel for Tesla you have to
 touch the wheel just enough you should trigger the torque sensor to tell itthat you're there but not enough as to
 disengage it which don't use it for two thingsyou disengage one wheel you don't have


0:47:32
Speaker 1 :to that whole experience Wow beautiful
 put that all those elements even if you don't have driver monitoring that wholeexperience needs to be better driver


0:47:41
Speaker 0 :monitoring I think would make I mean I
 think super cruise is a better experience once it's engaged overautopilot
 I think super cruise is our transition to engagement and disengagement aresignificantly worse yeah so there's a


0:47:54
Speaker 1 :tricky thing because if I were to
 criticize super cruise is uh it's a little too crude and uh I think it'slike six seconds or something if you
 look off-road you'll start warning you it's some ridiculously long period oftime and just the way it I think it's
 basically it's a binary chili adapter it

0:48:15
Speaker 0 :

0:48:17
Speaker 1 :yeah it's it just needs to learn more
 about you and used to communicate what it sees about you more like I'm not youknow Tesla shows what it sees about the
 external world it would be nice the supercruise would tell us what it seesabout the internal world it's even worse


0:48:31
Speaker 0 :than that you press the button to engage
 and it just says super cruise

0:48:35
Speaker 1 :unavailable yeah why why yeah that
 transparency is good we've renamed the

0:48:41
Speaker 0 :driver monitoring packet to driver state
 service state we have car state packet which has the state of the car driverstate packet which I stay the driver so
 what does itah make their BAC

0:48:54
Speaker 1 :must be do you think that's possible


0:48:55
Speaker 0 :

0:48:56
Speaker 1 :

0:48:59
Speaker 0 :with computer vision absolutely so to me


0:49:01
Speaker 1 :it's an open question I don't haven't
 looked into too much they actually had quite seriously looked at the literatureit's not obvious to me that from the
 eyes and so on you can tell you might

0:49:11
Speaker 0 :need to stuff from the car as well yeah
 you might need how they're controlling the car right and that's fundamentallyat the end of the day what you care
 about you but I think especially when people are really drunk they're notcontrolling the car nearly
 smoothly as they would look at them walking right there the car is like anextension of the body so I think you
 could totally detect and if you could fix people who drunk distracted asleepif you fix those three yeah this is


0:49:32
Speaker 1 :that's huge so what are the current
 limitations of open pilot what are the main problems that still need to be

0:49:41
Speaker 0 :solved um we're hopefully fixing a few
 of them in 0-6 we're not as good as auto pilot at stop cars so if you're comingup to a red light at like 55 so it's the
 radar stopped car problem which is responsible to auto pilot accidents it'shard to differentiate a stopped car from
 a like signpost yes that ecology um so you have to fuse you have to do thisvisually there's no way from the radar
 data to tell the difference maybe you could make a map but I really believe inmapping at all anymore um really what


0:50:14
Speaker 1 :you don't believe in mapping no so you
 basically the open pilot solution is saying react to the environment is justlike human doing beings and then


0:50:24
Speaker 0 :eventually when you want to do navigate
 on open pilot I'll train the net to look at ways all runways in the backgroundI'll train a car using GPS at all we use
 it to crown trees we use it to very carefully ground treat the paths we havea stack which can recover a relative to
 10 centimeters over one minute and then we use that to ground truth exactlywhere the car went in that local part of
 the environment but it's all local how

0:50:48
Speaker 1 :are you testing in general just for
 yourself like experiments stuff all right were you were you located SanDiego San Diego yeah okay Oh what you
 basically drive around there then collect some data and watch on Florence

0:51:02
Speaker 0 :we have a simulator now and we have our
 simulators really cool our simulator is not it's not like a unity basedsimulator our simulator lets us load in


0:51:12
Speaker 1 :real estate what I mean we can load in a


0:51:13
Speaker 0 :drive and simulate what the system would
 have done on the historical data ooh

0:51:20
Speaker 1 :nice interesting so what yeah right now


0:51:23
Speaker 0 :we're only using it for testing but as
 soon as we start using it for training

0:51:29
Speaker 1 :what's your feeling about the real world
 versus simulation do you like simulation for training if this moves to training

0:51:35
Speaker 0 :Chuck
 we have to distinguish two types of simulators right there's a simulatorthat light is completely fake I could
 get my car to drive around in GTA mm-hmm um I feel that this kind of simulator isuseless you're never there's so many my
 analogy here is like okay fine you're not solving the computer vision problembut you're solving the computer graphics
 problem right and you don't think you

0:52:02
Speaker 1 :can get very far about creating ultra
 realistic graphics no because you can

0:52:07
Speaker 0 :create ultra realistic graphics of the
 road now create alter a realistic behavioral models of the other cars ohwell I'll just use my self-driving no
 you won't you need real you need actual human behavior because that's whatyou're trying to learn the dead driving
 does not have a spec the definition of driving is what humans do when theydrive whatever way mode does I don't
 think it's driving right well I think if

0:52:33
Speaker 1 :you win more than others its if there's
 any useful reinforcement learning I've seen it used quite well I studypedestrians a lot too is try to train
 models from real data of how pedestrians move and try to use reinforcementlearning models to make pedestrians move
 in human-like ways by that point you've

0:52:50
Speaker 0 :already gone so many layers you detected
 a pedestrian did you did you hand code the feature vector of their state didyou guys learn anything from computer
 vision before deep learning well okay you know I feel like this is a

0:53:06
Speaker 1 :perception to you is the sticking point
 does that mean what what's what's the hardest part of the stack here there is

0:53:13
Speaker 0 :no human understandable feature vector
 separating perception and planning that's the best way I can I can put that

0:53:25
Speaker 1 :there is no so it's all together and
 it's it's a that's a joint problem so

0:53:29
Speaker 0 :you can take localization localization
 and planning there is a human understandable feature vector betweenthese two things I mean okay so I have
 like three degrees position three degrees orientation and thosederivatives maybe those second
 derivatives right that's human understandable that's physical thebetween perception and planning
 um so like way Moe has a perception stack and then a planner um and one ofthe things way matters right is they
 have a simulator that can separate those two they can like replay theirperception data and test their system
 which is what I'm talking about about like the two different kinds ofsimulators there's the kind that can
 work on real data and is the kind of can't work on real data now the problemis that I don't think you can hand code
 a feature vector right like like you have some lists of like well here's mylist of cars on the scenes here's my
 list of pedestrians in the scene this isn't what humans are doing what are

0:54:23
Speaker 1 :

0:54:25
Speaker 0 :humans doing global some something


0:54:27
Speaker 1 :you're saying that's too difficult to
 handle I'm saying that there is no state

0:54:31
Speaker 0 :vector given a perfect I could give you
 the best team of engineers in the world to build a perception system and thebest team to build a planner all you
 have to do is define the state vector that separates those two I'm missing the

0:54:43
Speaker 1 :state vector that separates those two


0:54:49
Speaker 0 :what do you mean so what is the output
 of your perception system

0:54:53
Speaker 1 :I'll put it the perception system it's
 theirs okay well there's several ways to do it one is this lamp componentslocalization the other is drivable area
 drivable space drivable space and then there's the different objects in thescene and different objects in the scene
 over time maybe to give you input to then try to start modeling thetrajectories of those objects sure


0:55:22
Speaker 0 :that's it I can give you a concrete
 example of something you missed what's thatso say there's a bush in the scene
 humans understand that when they see this bush that there may or may not be acar behind that bush drivable area and a
 list of objects does not include that humans are doing this constantly at thesimplest intersections so now you have
 to talk about occluded area right right but even that what do you mean byoccluded okay so I can't see it well if
 it's the other side of a house I don't care what's the likelihood that there'sa car in that occluded area right and if
 you say okay we'll add that I can come up with 10 more examples that you can'tadd


0:56:01
Speaker 1 :certainly occluded area would be
 something that simulator would have because it's simulating the entire youknow occlusion is part of it a part of a


0:56:10
Speaker 0 :vision stack pleasures that what I'm
 saying is if you have a hand engineered if your perception system output can bewritten in a spec document it is


0:56:22
Speaker 1 :incomplete yeah idem you know certainly
 it's it's hard to argue with that because in the end that's going to be

0:56:30
Speaker 0 :true yes I'll tell you what the output
 of our perception system is was that it's a thousand it's a thousand twentyfour dimensional vector training
 underling oh no not it's a thousand twenty fourdimensions of who knows what because its


0:56:42
Speaker 1 :operating on real data yeah yeah


0:56:46
Speaker 0 :and that's the perception that's the
 perception stake right think about a think about an autoencoder four phasesalright if you have an autoencoder four
 phases and you say it has 256 dimensions in middle and I'm taking a face overhere and projecting it to a face over
 here yeah can you hand label all 256 of those dimensions

0:57:06
Speaker 1 :well no but those are generated
 automatically but they but even if you

0:57:09
Speaker 0 :tried to do it by hand could you come up
 with a spec for your and between your encoder and your decoder

0:57:17
Speaker 1 :no no because that's not it is it wasn't
 designed but there no no but if you

0:57:21
Speaker 0 :could design it if you could design a
 face Reconstructor system could you come

0:57:28
Speaker 1 :up with a spec no but I think we're
 missing here a little bit I think the the you're just being very poetic aboutexpressing a fundamental problem of
 simulators that they're going to be missing so much that the feature vectorwould just look fundamentally different
 from in the simulated world in the real

0:57:51
Speaker 0 :world I'm not making a claim about
 simulators I'm making a claim about the spec division between perception andplanning and planning even in your


0:58:00
Speaker 1 :system just in general right just in


0:58:01
Speaker 0 :general if you're trying to build a car
 that drives if you're trying to hand code the output of your perceptionsystem like saying like here's a list of
 all the cars in the scene here's a list of all the people here's a list of theincluded areas here's a vector of
 drivable areas insufficient and if you start to believethat you realize that what Wayman crews
 are doing is impossible currently what

0:58:21
Speaker 1 :we're doing is the perception problem
 it's converting the scene into a chessboard you yeah and then you reasonsome basic reasoning around that
 chessboard yeah and you're saying that really there's a lot missing there firstof all why are we talking about this cuz
 isn't this a full autonomy is this something you think about oh I want to

0:58:44
Speaker 0 :win self-driving cars so you're really


0:58:47
Speaker 1 :your definition of win includes level of


0:58:52
Speaker 0 :fool five level five I don't think level
 four is a real thing I want to build I want to build the alphago of driving so

0:59:00
Speaker 1 :so alphago is really end to end yeah is
 uh yeah it's end to end and do you think this whole problem is those that alsokind of what you're getting at with the
 perception and the planning is that this whole problem the right way to do it isreally to learn the entire thing I'll


0:59:21
Speaker 0 :argue that not only is it the right way
 it's the only way that's going to exceed human performance well certainly truefor go everyone who tried to hand code
 go things built human inferior things and then someone came along and wrotesome 10,000 line thing that doesn't know
 anything about go that beat everybody it's 10,000 lines true in that sense the

0:59:41
Speaker 1 :the open question then that maybe I can
 ask you is uh driving is much harder than go the open question is how muchharder so how because I think the AH
 mosque approach here with planning and perception it's similar to what you'redescribing which is really turning into
 not some kind of modular thing but really do formulate is a learningproblem and it solves a learning problem
 of scale so how many years put one is how many years would it take to solvethis problem or just how hard is this


1:00:22
Speaker 0 :freaking problem well the cool thing is
 I think there's a lot of value that we can deliver along the way I think thatyou can build lane-keeping assist
 actually plus adaptive cruise control plus okay looking at ways extends tolike all of driving yeah most of driving


1:00:45
Speaker 1 :varies


1:00:47
Speaker 0 :oh your adaptive cruise control treats
 red lights like cars okay

1:00:51
Speaker 1 :so let's jump around with you you
 mentioned that you didn't like navigate an autopilot yeahwhat advice how would you make it better
 do you think as a feature that if it's done really well it's a good feature I

1:01:02
Speaker 0 :think that it's too reliant on like hand
 coded hacks for like how does navigate an autopilot do a lane change itactually does the same lane change every
 time and it feels mechanical humans do different lane changes human sometimewill do a slow one sometimes do a fast
 one navigate an autopilot at least every time I used it it did the identicallanguage how do you learn I mean this is


1:01:23
Speaker 1 :a fundamental thing actually yeah is uh
 the braking and an accelerating something that's still test the probablydoes it better than most cars but it
 still doesn't do a great job of creating a comfortable natural experience andnavigate on autopilot just lane changes
 an extension of that so how do you learn to do natural lane change so we have it

1:01:49
Speaker 0 :and I can talk about how it works so I
 feel that we have the solution for lateral but we don't yet have thesolution for longitudinal there's a few
 reasons longitudinal is harder than lateral the lane change component theway that we train on it very simply is
 like our model has an input for whether it's doing a lane change or not and thenwhen we train the end-to-end model we
 hand label all the lane changes because you have to I struggled a long timeabout not wanting to do that but I think
 you have to because you order the training data for the train data rightwell we actually we have an automatic
 ground truth or which automatically labels all the lane changes was thatpossible to automatically label interest
 yeah and detect the lane I see when it crosses it right I don't have to getthat that high percent accuracy but it's
 like 95 good enough now I set the bit when it's doing thelane change in the end-to-end learning
 and then I set it to zero when it's not doing a lane change so now if I wantedto do a lane change a test time I just
 put the bit to a 1 and I'll do later

1:02:52
Speaker 1 :yeah but so if you look at the space of
 lane change you know some percentage not a hundred percent that we make as humansis not a pleasant experience because we
 messed some part of it up yeah it's nerve-racking to change even look at theseizure des accelerate how do we label
 the ones that are natural and feel good you know that's the because that's yourultimate criticism the current Oh
 navigate not apologies doesn't feel good

1:03:16
Speaker 0 :well the current navigator on autopilot
 is a hand coded policy written by an engineer in a room who probably went outand tested it a few times on the 280


1:03:25
Speaker 1 :probably a more a better version of that
 but yes that's how we would have written

1:03:29
Speaker 0 :it a comment yeah Tesla they tested it
 and it might have been two engineers yeah no but so if you learn the lanechange if you learn how to do a lane
 change from data just like just like you have a label that says lane change andthen you put it in when you want to do
 the lane change it'll automatically do the lane change that's appropriate forthe situation now to get it the problem
 of some humans do bad lane changes we haven't worked too much on this problemyet it's not that much of a problem in
 practice my theory is that all good drivers are good in the same way and allbad drivers are bad in different ways
 and we've we've seen some data to back

1:04:11
Speaker 1 :this up well beautifully put so you just
 basically if that's true yeah hypothesis then you know task is to discover thegood drivers um the good drivers stand


1:04:19
Speaker 0 :out because they're in one cluster and
 the bad drivers are scattered all over the place and your net learns the

1:04:26
Speaker 1 :cluster yeah that's uh
 so you just learned from the good drivers and they're easy to cluster we

1:04:32
Speaker 0 :learned from all of them and that
 automatically learns the policy that's like the majority but we'll eventuallyprobably afterthought so if that theory


1:04:39
Speaker 1 :is true I hope it's true because the the
 counter theory is there is many clusters maybebut rarely many clusters of good drivers
 because if there's one cluster of good drivers you can at least discover a setof policies you can learn a set of
 policies which would be good universally yeah that would be a nice that would benice if it's true and you're saying that
 there are some evidence that let's say

1:05:06
Speaker 0 :lane changes can be clustered into four
 clusters right right there's this finite

1:05:10
Speaker 1 :

1:05:12
Speaker 0 :level of I would argue that all four of
 those are good clusters all the things that are random are noise and probablybad and which one of the four you pick
 or maybe it's Tanner maybe it's twenty you can learn them it's contextdependent it depends on the scene and


1:05:26
Speaker 1 :the hope is it's not too dependent on
 the driver

1:05:30
Speaker 0 :yeah the hope is that it all washes out
 the hope is that there's that the distribution is not bimodal the hope isthat it's a nice gas man so what advice


1:05:39
Speaker 1 :would you give to Tessa how to fix how
 to improve navigate an autopilot the lessons you've learned from Kamiya

1:05:47
Speaker 0 :the only real advice I would give to
 Tesla is please put driver monitoring in your cars with respect to improvement

1:05:54
Speaker 1 :you can't do that anymore I said to
 interrupt but you know there's a practical nature of many of hundreds ofthousands of cars being produced that
 don't have a good driver facing camera

1:06:06
Speaker 0 :the model 3 has a selfie cam is it not
 good enough did they not have put IR LEDs for night that's a good question

1:06:10
Speaker 1 :but I do know that the is fisheye in its
 relatively low resolution so it's really not this I he wasn'tit wasn't designed for Arman you can
 hope that you can kind of scrape up and and and have something from it yeah but

1:06:26
Speaker 0 :put it in today put it in today today
 every time I've heard Carpathia talk about the problem and talking about lifesoftware 2.0 and how the machine
 learning is gobbling up everything I think this is absolutely the rightstrategy I think that he didn't write
 navigate on autopilot I think somebody else did and kind of hacked it on top ofthat stuff I think what Carpathia says
 wait a second why did we hand code this lane change policy with all these magicnumbers we're gonna learn it from data
 they'll fix it they already know what to do there well that that's that's Andres

1:06:51
Speaker 1 :job is to turn everything into a
 learning problem and collect a huge amount of data the the reality is thoughnot every problem could be turned into a
 learning problem in the short term in the endeverything would be a learning problem
 the reality is like if you want to build alpha vehicles today it will likelyinvolve no learning and that's that's
 the the reality is so at which point does learning start it's the crutchstatement that lidar is a crutch
 on which point will learning get up to part of human performance it's all overhuman performance and imagenet
 classification under ivan is the

1:07:34
Speaker 0 :question still it is a question I'll say
 this I'm I'm here to play for 10 years I'm not here to try to I'm here to playfor 10 years and make money along the
 way I'm not here to try to promise people that I'm gonna have my l5 taxiNetwork up and working in two years do


1:07:48
Speaker 1 :you think those mistake yes what do you
 think there was the motivation behind saying that other companies are alsopromising alpha vehicles with their
 different approaches in 2020 2021 2022

1:08:01
Speaker 0 :if anybody would like to bet me that
 those things do not pan out I will I will bet you even money even money I'llbet you as much as you want so are you


1:08:11
Speaker 1 :worried about what's going to happen
 because you're not in full agreement on that I was going to happen when 2022 21come around and nobody has fleets of


1:08:22
Speaker 0 :autonomous vehicles no you can look at
 the history if you go back five years ago they were all promised by 2018 and2017 but they weren't that strong of


1:08:30
Speaker 1 :promises I mean Ford really declared
 pretty that I think not many have declared as as like definitively as theyhave now these dates well okay so let's


1:08:42
Speaker 0 :separate l4 and l5 do I think that it's
 possible for way mo to continue to kind of like like hack on their system untilit gets to level 4 in Chandler Arizona


1:08:54
Speaker 1 :yes knows no safety driver Chandler


1:08:57
Speaker 0 :

1:08:58
Speaker 1 :Arizona yeah but by OSI which year are
 we talking about

1:09:02
Speaker 0 :oh I even think that's possible by like
 2020 2021 but level 4 Chandler Arizona not level 5 New York City level 4

1:09:11
Speaker 1 :meaning some very defined streets it
 works out really well very defined

1:09:17
Speaker 0 :streets and then
 these streets are pretty empty if most of the streets are covered in way MOS wemo can kind of change the definition of
 what driving is hmm right if your self-driving network is the majority ofcars in an area they only need to be
 safe with respect to each other and all the humans will need to learn to adaptto them now go drive in downtown New
 York oh yeah that's already you can talkabout autonomy in like like fun farms it
 already works great because you can really just follow the GPS line so what

1:09:51
Speaker 1 :does success look like for comm AI what
 what are the milestones like where you can sit back with some champagne and saywe did it boys and girls


1:10:03
Speaker 0 :well it's never over yeah but don't be


1:10:08
Speaker 1 :let's drink champagne everything
 straight so what is a good what are some wins um a big milestone that we're

1:10:13
Speaker 0 :hoping for by mid next year is
 profitability of the company and we're gonna have to revisit the idea ofselling a consumer product but it's not
 gonna be like the comma one when we do it it's gonna be perfectopen pilot has gotten so much better in
 the last two years we're gonna have a few a few features we're gonna have ahundred percent driver monitoring we're
 gonna disable no safety features in the car um actually I think it'd be reallycool we're doing right now our project
 this week is we're analyzing the data set and looking for all the AEP triggersfrom the manufacturer systems we have a
 better data set on that than the manufacturers how much does how manydoes Toyota have ten million miles of
 real-world driving to know how many times they're AUB triggered so let me

1:11:05
Speaker 1 :give you cuz yes right
 financial advice yeah cuz I work with a lot of automakers and one possiblesource of money for you which I'll be
 excited to see you take on is basically selling the data so which is somethingthat most people are not selling in a
 way we're here here at automaker but creating we've done this actually at MITnot for money purposes but you could do
 it for significant money purposes and make the world a better place bycreating a consortium where automakers
 would pay in and then they get to have free access to the data and I I think alot of people are really hungry for that
 and would pay significant amount of money for it here's the problem with

1:11:54
Speaker 0 :that I like this idea all in theory he'd
 be very easy for me to give them access to my servers and we already have allopen source tools to access this data
 it's in a great format we have a great pipeline but they're gonna put me in theroom with some business development guy
 mm-hmm and I'm gonna have to talk to this guy and he's not gonna know most ofthe words I'm saying I'm not willing to


1:12:17
Speaker 1 :tolerate that okay but I think I agree
 with you I'm the same way but you just tell them the terms and there's nodiscussion needed if if I could just


1:12:25
Speaker 0 :tell them the terms yeah and then like
 all right who wants access to my data I will sell it to you for let's say youwant to go on a subscription I'll sell
 you 400 a month any 100k mo 100k month I'll give you access to the datasubscription yeah yeah I think that's
 kind of fair came up with that number off the top of my head if somebody sendsme like a three line email where it's
 like we would like to pay a hundred K month to get access to your data wewould agree to like reasonable privacy
 terms of the people who are in the data set I would be happy to do it but that'snot gonna be the email the email is
 gonna be hey do you have some time in the next month where we can sit down andwe can I don't have time for that we're
 moving too fast yeah you could politely

1:13:08
Speaker 1 :respond to that email but not saying I
 don't have any time for your [ __ ] yeah you say oh well unfortunately theseare the terms and so this is we try to
 we brought the cost down for you in order to minimize the friction ofeducation after here's the whatever it
 is 1 2 million years dollars a year and you have access and it's not like I get

1:13:28
Speaker 0 :that email from like but okay am I gonna
 reach out am I gonna hire a business development person who's gonna reach outto the automaker's no way yeah okay


1:13:36
Speaker 1 :

1:13:38
Speaker 0 :if they reached into me I'm not gonna
 ignore the email I'll come back with something straight yeah if you'rewilling just pay honeycomb all the facts
 they don't man I'm happy to to set that up that's whatmy engineering time but actually quite


1:13:48
Speaker 1 :insightful view you're right yeah
 probably because many of the automakers are quite a bit of old-school yeah therewill be need to reach out and they want
 it but they they'll need to be some some communication you right mobile eye

1:14:00
Speaker 0 :circuit 2015 had the lowest R&D spend of
 any chip maker like purpur and you look at all the people who work for them andit's all business development people
 because the car companies are impossible to work with yeah so you're you have no

1:14:15
Speaker 1 :patience for that and you're you're
 legit Android huh I have something to do

1:14:20
Speaker 0 :right like like it's not like it's not
 like I don't like I don't mean to like be a dick and say like I don't havepatience for that but it's like that
 stuff doesn't help us with our goal of winning self-driving cars if I wantmoney in the short term if I showed off
 like the actual like the learning tech that we have it's it's somewhat sad likeit's years and years ahead of everybody
 else's not so maybe not Tesla's I think Tesla has similar stuff to us actuallyyeah I think Tesla's similar stuff but
 when you compare it to like what the Toyota Research Institute has you're noteven close to what we have no comment


1:14:53
Speaker 1 :but I also can't I have to take your
 comments I ain't into ative Lee believe you but I have to take it with a grainof salt because I mean you you are an
 inspiration because you basically don't care about a lot of things that othercompanies care about you don't try to
 [ __ ] in a sense like make up stuff so to drive a valuation you're reallyvery real and you're trying to solve the
 problem and admire that a lot what I don't necessarily fully can't trust youon I do respect it's like how good it is
 right I can only but I also know how badothers are and so I'll say I'll say two


1:15:33
Speaker 0 :things about don't trust but verify
 right I'll say two things about that one is try get in a twenty twenty Corollaand try open pal 0.6 when it comes out
 next month I think already you'll look at this and you'll be like them this isalready really good and then I could be
 doing that all with hand labelers and all with with like like the sameapproach that like Mobileye uses when we
 release a model that no law has the lanes in it that only outputs apath mm-hmm
 then think about how we did that machine learning and then right away when yousee and that's gonna be an open pilot
 that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0 when you see that model you'll know thateverything I'm saying is true because
 how else did I get that model good one of the things too about the simulator ohyeah yeah this is super exciting that's


1:16:20
Speaker 1 :super exciting and uh but like you know


1:16:23
Speaker 0 :I listened to your talk with Kyle and
 Kyle was originally building the the after market system and he gave up on itbecause of technical challenges yeah
 because of the fact that he's gonna have to support twenty to fifty cars wesupport forty five because what is he
 gonna do when the manufacturer ABS system triggers we have alerts andwarnings to deal with all of that in all
 the cars and how is he going to formally verify it well I got ten million milesof data it's probably better it's
 probably better verified than the spec

1:16:53
Speaker 1 :yeah I'm glad you're here talking to me
 this is I'll remember this day is this interesting if you look at Kyle's fromfrom Cruz I'm sure they have a large
 number of business development folks and you work with he's working with GM youcould work with agro a I working with
 Ford it's interesting because chances that you fail business-wise likebankrupt are pretty high yeah and and
 yet it's the Android model is you're actually taking on the problem so that'sreally inspiring I mean well I have a


1:17:28
Speaker 0 :long-term way for kamma to make money
 too and one of the nice things when you

1:17:31
Speaker 1 :really take on the problem which is my
 hope for autopilot for example is things you don't expect ways to make money orcreate value that you don't expect will


1:17:44
Speaker 0 :pop up oh I've known how to do it
 since kind of 2017 is the first time I said it well which part to know it to

1:17:48
Speaker 1 :know how to do which part our long-term


1:17:50
Speaker 0 :plan is to be a car insurance company


1:17:53
Speaker 1 :insurance yeah I love it yeah yeah what


1:17:54
Speaker 0 :I make driving twice is safe not only
 that I have the best date is that you know who statistically is the safestdrivers and oh oh we see you we see you
 driving unsafely we're not going to insure you and that that causes a likebifurcation in the market because the
 only people who can't get common insurance or the bad drivers Geico caninsure them their premiums
 crazy higher premiums are crazy low would win contracts take over that whole

1:18:18
Speaker 1 :market okay so if we win if we went but


1:18:20
Speaker 0 :that's I'm saying like how do you turn
 comma into a ten billion dollar company is that that's right

1:18:25
Speaker 1 :so you you know a musk who else who else
 is thinking like this and working like this in your view who are thecompetitors are there people seriously I
 don't think anyone that I'm aware of as seriously taking on lane-keeping youknow like to worse a huge business that
 turns eventually into full autonomy that then creates yeah like that createsother businesses on top of it and so on
 thinks insurance thinks all kinds of ideas like that do you know who anyoneelse thinking like this not really


1:18:59
Speaker 0 :

1:19:02
Speaker 1 :that's interesting I mean it my sense is
 everybody turns to that in like four or five years like Ford once the autonomydoesn't feel fall through but at this


1:19:13
Speaker 0 :time Elon to the iOS by the way he paved
 the way for all I was not i OS true I would not be doing comma AI today if itwas not for those conversations with
 Elon and if it were not for him saying like yeah I think he said like wellobviously we're not gonna use Leiter we
 use cameras humans use cameras so what

1:19:31
Speaker 1 :do you think about that how important is
 lidar everybody else is on l5 is using lidar what are your thoughts on hisprovocative statement that lidar is a


1:19:41
Speaker 0 :crutch see sometimes we'll say dumb
 things like the driver monitoring thing but sometimes we'll say absolutelycompletely 100% obviously true things
 yeah of course lidar is a crutch it's not even a good crutch you're not evenusing it they're using it for
 localization yeah which isn't good in the first place if you have to localizeyour car to centimetres in order to
 drive like yeah they're not drive it

1:20:03
Speaker 1 :currently not doing much machine
 learning I thought polite our data meaning like to help you in the tasks ofgeneral tasks of perception the main


1:20:13
Speaker 0 :goal of those light hours on those cars
 I think is actually localization more than perception or at least that's whatthey use them for yeah that's true if
 you want to localize two centimeters you can't use GPS the fanciest GPS in theworld can't do it especially if you're
 under tree cover and stuff flatter I can do it pretty easily see

1:20:28
Speaker 1 :really they're not taking on I mean in
 some research they're doing they're using it for perception but and they'recertainly not which sad they're not
 fusing it well lay vision they do use it

1:20:38
Speaker 0 :for perception I'm not saying they don't
 use it for perception but the thing that they have vision based and radar basedperception systems as well you could
 remove the lidar and and and keep around a lot of the dynamic object perceptionyou want to get centimeter accurate
 localization good luck doing that with anything else so what should Cruz lame-o

1:20:59
Speaker 1 :do like what would you be your advice to
 them now anyway Mo's actually there's I mean they're doing they're serious waymo out of all of them equate so serious
 about the long game if everybody fell five is a lot is requires fifty years Ithink when will be the only one left
 standing at the end with the forgiving the financial backing if they have

1:21:27
Speaker 0 :Google box um I'll say nice things about
 both lame-o and Cruz let's do it nice is

1:21:33
Speaker 1 :

1:21:35
Speaker 0 :good way mo is by far the furthest along
 with technology way mo has a three to five year lead on all the competitors umif that if the way mo looking stack
 works mm-hmm maybe three year lead if the way mo looking stack works they havea three year lead now I argue that way
 mo has spent too much money to recapitalize to gain back theirlosses in those three years also
 self-driving cars have no network effect like that yeah goober has a networkeffect you have a market you have
 drivers and you have riders self-driving cars you have capital and you haveriders there's no network effect if I
 want to blanket a new city in self-driving cars i buy theoff-the-shelf Chinese knockoff
 self-driving cars and I buy enough up from the city I can't do that withdrivers and that's why Ober has a first
 mover advantage that no self-driving car company will can you uh disentangle that

1:22:24
Speaker 1 :a little bit uber you're not talking
 about uber the autonomous vehicle number you talked about the uber cars okay yeah

1:22:32
Speaker 0 :I'm over I open for business in Austin
 Texas listen I need to attract both sides of the market I need to both getdrivers
 my platform and riders on my platinum and I need to keep them bothsufficiently happy right riders aren't
 going to use it if it takes more than five minutes for an uber to show updrivers aren't gonna use it if they have
 to sit around all day and there's no riders so you have to carefully balancea market and whenever you have to
 carefully balance a market there's a great first mover advantage becausethere's a switching cost for everybody
 right the drivers and the riders would have to switch at the same time let'seven say that you know um let's say
 Luber shows up in Luber somehow you know agrees to do things that add a biggeryou know you know we're just gonna we've
 done it more efficiently right Luber is only takes five percent of a cot insteadof the ten percent that Hooper takes no
 one is gonna switch because the switching cost is higher than that fivepercent so you actually can in markets
 like that you have a first mover advantage yeah autonomous vehicles ofthe level five variety have no first
 mover advantage if the technology becomes commoditized say I want to go toa new city look at the scooters it's
 gonna look a lot more like scooters every person with a checkbook canblanket a city in scooters and that's
 why you have 10 different scooter companies yeah which one's gonna winit's a race to the bottom it's terrible
 market to begin because there's no market for scooters and scooters don'tget a say and whether they want to be
 bought and deployed to a city or not right so the yeah we're gonna entice thescooters with subsidies and deals so


1:24:04
Speaker 1 :whenever you have to invest that capital
 that's it doesn't it doesn't come back yeah that they can't be your maincriticism over the way mo approach oh
 I'm saying even if it does technically

1:24:12
Speaker 0 :work even if it does technically work


1:24:15
Speaker 1 :that's a problem yeah I don't know I if
 I were to say I I would I would say you're already there I haven't eventhought about that but I would say the
 bigger challenge is the technical approach so way most cruises and not

1:24:30
Speaker 0 :

1:24:31
Speaker 1 :just the technical approach but of
 creating value I still don't understand how you beat uber the the human drivencars in terms of financially it doesn't
 it doesn't make sense to me that people want to want to get an autonomousvehicle I don't understand how you make
 money in the long term like real long-term but it just feelslike there's too much capital investment
 needed oh and they're gonna be worse

1:25:00
Speaker 0 :than ubers because they're gonna they're
 gonna stop for every little you know thing everywhere um actually a nicething about Cruz that was my nice thing
 about wait another three years that it wasn't nice oh that's three yearstechnically ahead of everybody their
 tech stack is is great my nice thing about Cruz is GM buying them was a greatmove for GM for 1 billion dollars GM
 bought an insurance policy against way mo they put Cruz is three years behindway mo hmm that means Google will get a
 monopoly on the technology for at most three years and technology works

1:25:36
Speaker 1 :you might not even be right about the
 three years it might be less might be

1:25:42
Speaker 0 :less crews actually might not be that
 far behind I don't know how much way mo has waffled around or how much of itactually is just that long tail yeah


1:25:49
Speaker 1 :okay if that's the best you could say
 there's some nice things it that's more of a nice thing for GM that that's asmart insurance policy it's just more


1:25:58
Speaker 0 :insurance policy I mean I think that's
 how I I can't see crews working out any other for crews to leapfrog way mo wouldreally surprise me yeah so let's talk


1:26:10
Speaker 1 :about like the underlying assumptions of
 everything is we're not going to

1:26:13
Speaker 0 :leapfrog Tesla Tesla would have to
 seriously mess up for us because you're

1:26:20
Speaker 1 :okay so the way you leapfrog right is
 you come up with an idea or you take a direction perhaps secretly that theother people aren't taking and so cruise
 way mo even Aurora no Aurora tzuke's is

1:26:38
Speaker 0 :the same stack as well they're all the
 same codebase even and they're all the same DARPA urban challenge codebase

1:26:44
Speaker 1 :so the question is do you think there's
 a room for brilliance and innovation there that will change everything likesay okay so I'll give you examples it
 could be if revolution and mapping for example that allow you to map things doHD maps of the whole world all weather
 conditions

1:27:10
Speaker 0 :really well or revolutionist simulation


1:27:11
Speaker 1 :to where the the what you said before
 becomes incorrect that kind of thing I knew room for breakthrough innovation um

1:27:23
Speaker 0 :what I said before about oh they
 actually get the whole thing well I'll say this about we divide driving intothree problems and I actually haven't
 solved the third yet but I have an idea how to do it so there's the static thestatic driving problem is assuming you
 are the only car on the road right right and this problem can be solved 100% withmapping and localization this is why
 farms work the way they do if all you have to deal with is the static problemand you can statically schedule your
 machines right it's the same as like statically scheduling processes you canstatically schedule your tractors to
 never hit each other on their paths all right because then you know the speedthey go at so so that's the static
 driving problem Maps only helps you with the static driving problem yeah the

1:28:03
Speaker 1 :question about static driving yeah you
 just made it sound like it's really easy

1:28:09
Speaker 0 :that was really easy how easy how well


1:28:11
Speaker 1 :because the whole drifting out of lane
 when when Tesla drifts out of lane is failing on the fundamental staticdriving problem Tesla is drifting out of


1:28:22
Speaker 0 :lane the static driving problem is not
 easy for the world the static driving problem is easy for one route and one

1:28:31
Speaker 1 :route in one weather condition with one
 state of lane markings and like no deterioration no cracks in the road I'm

1:28:41
Speaker 0 :assuming you have a perfect localizer so
 that's all for the weather condition and me the lane marking condition that's the

1:28:46
Speaker 1 :problem is how could you how do you have
 a perfect you can build perfect

1:28:48
Speaker 0 :localizers are not that hard to build


1:28:50
Speaker 1 :okay come on now with with wood lighter


1:28:54
Speaker 0 :why don't ya wood lighter okay yeah but
 you use lighter right like use lidar build a perfect localizer building aperfect localizer without lidar it's
 gonna be it's gonna be hard you can get ten centimeters without liner you canget one centimeter with lidar maybe


1:29:07
Speaker 1 :concern about the one or ten centimeter
 I'm concerned if every once in a while you're just way off yeah so this is why

1:29:13
Speaker 0 :you have to carefully make sure you're
 always tracking your position you want to use lightcamera fusion but you can get the
 reliability of that system up to a hundred thousand miles and then youwrite some fallback condition where it's
 not that bad if you're way off right I think that you can get it to the pointit's like zil D that you're you're
 never in a case where you're way off and you don't know it yeah okay so this is

1:29:39
Speaker 1 :brilliant so that's the static static we
 can especially with lidar and good HD maps you can solve that problem easy

1:29:49
Speaker 0 :no you just the static static very


1:29:52
Speaker 1 :typical for you to say something's easy
 I got it it's not as challenging as the other ones okay well it's okay maybe

1:29:57
Speaker 0 :it's obvious how to solve it the third
 one's the hardest well where do we get and a lot of people don't even thinkabout the third one and even I see it as
 different from the second one so the second one is dynamic the second one islike say there's an obvious examples
 like a car stopped at a red light right you can't have that car in yourmap yeah because you don't know whether
 that car is gonna be there or not so you have to detect that car in real time andthen you have to you know do the
 appropriate action right also that car is not a fixed object that car may moveand you have to predict with that car
 will dim alright so this is the dynamic problem yeah do you have to deal withthis um this involves again like you're
 gonna need models of other people's behavior do you are you including in

1:30:38
Speaker 1 :that and I don't want to step on on the
 third one oh but if I are you including in that you're influenced and people I

1:30:48
Speaker 0 :guess the third okay that's the moon we
 call it the counterfactual yeah I

1:30:52
Speaker 1 :believe that I just talked to Judea
 pearl who's obsessed with

1:30:56
Speaker 0 :counterfactuals oh yeah yeah so the
 static and the dynamic yeah our approach right now for lateral willscale completely to the static a dynamic
 the counterfactual the only way I have to do it yet they don't give you thingthat I want to do once we have all these
 cars is I want to do reinforcement learning on the world I'm always gonnaturn the exploiter up to max I'm not
 gonna have them explore but the only real way to get at the counterfactual isto do reinforcement learning because the
 other agents are humans so that's

1:31:28
Speaker 1 :fascinating that you break you down like
 that I agree completely I've set my life

1:31:31
Speaker 0 :thinking about this beautiful


1:31:34
Speaker 1 :they're so and part of it because you're
 slightly insane because not my life just

1:31:41
Speaker 0 :the last four years no no you have like


1:31:43
Speaker 1 :some some nonzero percent of your brain
 has a madman in it which that's a really good feature but there's a safetycomponent to it that I think when this
 sort of counterfactuals and so on that would just freak people out how do youeven start to think about just in
 general I mean you've you've had some friction with Nitza and so on I amfrankly exhausted by safety engineers
 the the prioritization on safety over innovation to a degree where it kills inmy view kills safety in the long term so
 the counterfactual thing they just just actually exploring this world of how doyou interact with dynamic objects and so
 on how do you how do you think about safety you can do reinforcement learning

1:32:35
Speaker 0 :without ever exploring and I said that
 like so you can think about you're in like a reinforcement learning it'susually called like a temperature
 parameter and your temperature parameter is how often you deviate from the Argmax I could always set that to zero and
 still learn and I feel that you'd always want that set to zero on your actual

1:32:54
Speaker 1 :system got you but the problem is you
 first don't know very much and so you're going to make mistakes so the learningthe exploration happens to ready yeah


1:33:02
Speaker 0 :but okay so the consequences of a
 mistake yeah open pilot and autopilot are making mistakes left and right yeahwe have we have we have 700 daily active
 users a thousand weekly active users open pilot makes tens of thousands ofmistakes a week these mistakes have zero
 consequences these mistakes are oh it I wanted to take this exit and it wentstraight so I'm just gonna carefully
 touch the wheel humans the humans catch themand the human disengagement is labeling
 that reinforcement learning in a completely consequence-free way so

1:33:37
Speaker 1 :driver monitoring is the way you ensure
 they keep yes they keep paying attention how is your messaging say I gave you abillion dollars you would be scaling and
 now

1:33:48
Speaker 0 :oh my fact it's guy couldn't scale with
 any amount of money I'd raise money if I could if I had way to scale yeah you're

1:33:52
Speaker 1 :not focusing I don't know I don't know


1:33:53
Speaker 0 :how to do Oh like I guess I could sell
 it to more people but I want to make the system better better I don't know I mean

1:33:59
Speaker 1 :but what's the messaging here I got a
 chance to talk to you on and and he he basically said that the human factordoesn't matter you know the human
 doesn't matter because the system will perform there would be sort of a sorryto use the term but like a singular like
 a point where it gets just much better and so the human it won't won't reallymatter but it seems like that human
 caching the system when it gets into trouble is like the thing which willmake something like reinforcement
 learning work so how do you how do you think messaging for Tesla for you shouldchant for the industry in general should
 change I think my messaging is pretty

1:34:39
Speaker 0 :clear at least like our messaging wasn't
 that clear in the beginning and I do kind of fault myself for that we areproud right now to be a level 2 system
 we are proud to be level 2 if we talk about level 4 it's not what the currenthardware it's not gonna be just a
 magical OTA upgrade it's gonna be new hardware it's gonna be very carefullythought-out right now we are proud to be
 level 2 and we have a rigorous safety model I mean not like like okay rigorouswho knows what that means but we at
 least have a safety model and we make it explicit is in safety MD and open pilotand it says seriously though safety dot


1:35:17
Speaker 1 :MD Android so well this is this is the


1:35:19
Speaker 0 :safety model and I like to have
 conversations like if like you know sometimes people will come to you andthey're like your systems not safe okay
 have you read my safety Doc's would you like to have an intelligent conversationabout this and the answer is always no
 they just like scream about it runs Python okay what so you're saying thatthat because pythons not real-time
 Python not being real-time never causes disengagement disengagement SAR causedby you know the model is QM but safety
 dad MD says the following first and foremost the driver must be payingattention at all times
 I don't can I do I still consider the software to be alpha software until wecan actually enforce that statement but
 I feel it's very well communicated to our users two morethings one is the user must be able to
 easily take control of the vehicle at all timesmm-hmm so if you step on the gas or
 brake with open pilot it gives full manual control back to theuser or press the cancel button step 2
 the car will never react so quickly we define so quickly to be about one secondthat you can't react in time and we do
 this by enforcing torque limits braking limits and acceleration limits so wehave um like our torque limits way lower
 than Tesla's this is another potential if I could tweak autopilotI would lower their torque limit or
 would a driver monitoring um because autopilot can jerk the wheel hard yeahopen pilot can it's we we limit um and
 all this code is open source readable and I believe now it's all misery C

1:36:55
Speaker 1 :compliant misra is like the automotive


1:36:56
Speaker 0 :coding standard um at first I you know
 I've come to respect I've been reading like the standards lately and I've cometo respect them they're actually written
 by very smart people yeah they're

1:37:08
Speaker 1 :brilliant people actually they have a
 lot of experience there's sometimes a little too cautious but in this case itpays off miss was written by like


1:37:17
Speaker 0 :computer scientists and you tell them as
 a language they use you can tell by the language they use they talk about likewhether certain conditions in misra are
 decidable or undecidable you mean like the halting problem and yes well allright you've earned my respect I will
 tell you carefully what you have to say and we want to make our code compliantwith that all right so you're proud


1:37:36
Speaker 1 :level two and reform so you were the
 founder and I think CEO of comm AI then you were the head of research what theheck are you know what's your connection
 to come AI the president but I'm one of

1:37:48
Speaker 0 :those like unelect unelected presidents
 of like like a small dictatorship country not one of those like electedpresidents oh so you're like Putin when


1:37:55
Speaker 1 :he was like yeah I got sure so there's


1:37:59
Speaker 0 :

1:38:00
Speaker 1 :uh what's the governance structure
 what's the what's the future of commie I finance I mean as a business do you wantyou just focused on getting things right
 now making some small amount of money and mean toand then one that works it works in each
 scale our burn rate is about 200k a

1:38:18
Speaker 0 :month and our revenue is about 100k a
 month so we need to 4x our revenue but uh we haven't like tried very hard atthat yet


1:38:28
Speaker 1 :and the revenue is basically selling
 stuff online yeah we sell stuff shopped

1:38:31
Speaker 0 :a comment at AI is there other well okay


1:38:33
Speaker 1 :so you you'll have to figure out that's


1:38:36
Speaker 0 :our that's our only see but to me that's
 like respectable revenues yeah we make it by selling products to consumerswe're honest and transparent about what
 they are most actually level for

1:38:46
Speaker 1 :companies right because you could easily
 start blowing up like smoke like over selling the hype and feeding intogetting some fundraisers oh you're the
 guy you're genius because you hacked the iPhone oh I hate that I hate that yeah I

1:39:02
Speaker 0 :can trade my social capital for more
 money yeah I did it once I almost regret itdoing the first of it well on a small


1:39:10
Speaker 1 :tangent what's your you seem to not like
 Fame and yet you're also drawn to fame what were you on we're on you where areyou on that currently have you had some
 introspection some soul-searching yeah I actually I've come to a pretty

1:39:28
Speaker 0 :stable position on that like after the
 first time I realized that I don't want attention from the massesI want attention from people who I
 respect who you respect I can give a

1:39:40
Speaker 1 :

1:39:42
Speaker 0 :

1:39:44
Speaker 1 :list of people so are these like Elon
 must have characters yeah

1:39:47
Speaker 0 :well actually you know what I'll make it
 more broad than that I won't make it about a person I respect skill I respectpeople who have skills right and I would
 like to like be I'm not gonna say famous but be like known among more people who

1:40:07
Speaker 1 :have like real skills who in cars doers
 do you think have skill not do you

1:40:14
Speaker 0 :respect Oh Kyle vote has skill a lot of
 people away mo have skill and I respect them I I respect them as engineers likeI can think I mean I think about all the
 times in my life where I've been like dead set on approaches and they turn outto be wrong
 so I mean this might I might be wrong I accept that I accept that there's adecent chance that I'm I'm wrong and
 actually I mean having talked to Chris

1:40:37
Speaker 1 :Urmson sterling anderson i those those
 guys I mean I deeply respect Chris I just admire the guy he's legit can youdrive a car through the desert when
 everybody thinks it's impossible that is that's legit and then I also really

1:40:53
Speaker 0 :respect the people who are like writing
 the infrastructure of the world like the linus torvalds and the chris lab they'redoing the real work I know they're doing


1:40:58
Speaker 1 :

1:41:00
Speaker 0 :the real work this every dog that Chris


1:41:01
Speaker 1 :Ladin you realize especially when
 they're humble it's like you realize oh you guys were just using your oh yeahall the hard work they did him that's
 incredible what do you think mr. Anthony lowendahl skiwhat do you he's a he's another mad
 genius sharp guy oh yeah what do you think he might long-term become acompetitor Oh


1:41:28
Speaker 0 :tu cama well so I think that he has the
 other right approach I think that right now there's two right approaches one iswhat we're doing and one is what he's
 doing can you describe I think it's

1:41:38
Speaker 1 :called pronto a certain you thing did do
 you know what what the approaches actually don't know embark is also doing

1:41:43
Speaker 0 :the same sort of thing the idea is
 almost that you want to so if you're I can't partner with Honda and ToyotaHonda and Toyota are uh like four
 hundred thousand person companies it's not even a company at that point like Idon't think of it like I don't personify
 it I think of it like an object but a truckerdrives for a fleet maybe that has like
 some truckers are independent some truckers Drive for fleets with a hundredtrucks there are tons of independent
 trucking companies out there start a trucking company and drive your costsdown or figure out how to drive down the
 cost of trucking another company that I really respect is uh not oh I should Irespect their business model no auto
 sells a driver monitoring camera and they sell it to fleet owners if I that'sright if I owned a fleet of cars and I
 could pay you know 40 bucks a month to monitor my employeesthis is gonna like reduces accidents 18%
 yeah it's it's so like that in the space that is like the business model that Ilike most respect is there creating
 value today yeah which is uh that's a

1:42:55
Speaker 1 :huge one is how do we create value today
 with some of this then the link keeping things huge and it sounds like you'recreeping in or full steam ahead on the
 driver monitoring - yeah which I think actually were the short-term value ifyou can get right I still I'm not a huge
 fan of the statement that everything is to have driver monitoring but will Iagree with that completely but I'm that
 statement usually misses the point that to get the experience of it right is nottrivial oh no not at all in fact like so


1:43:22
Speaker 0 :right now we have I think the time out
 depends on speed of the car but we want to depend on like the scenes day ifyou're on like an empty Highway it's
 very different if you don't pay attention then if light you're likecoming up to a traffic light and


1:43:42
Speaker 1 :long-term it should probably learn from
 from the driver because that's to do I watched a lot of video we've built asmartphone detector just to analyze how
 people are using smartphones and people are using it very differently andthere's a it's a texting styles there's


1:43:58
Speaker 0 :videos yeah like I got billions of miles
 of people driving cars in this moment I

1:44:02
Speaker 1 :spent a large fraction of my time just
 watching videos because it's never fails to to learn like it never I've neverfailed from a video watching session to
 learn something I didn't know before fact I usually like when I eat lunchI'll sit especially when the weather is
 good and just watch pedestrians with an eye to understand like from a computervision I just to see can this model can
 you predict what are the decisions made and there's so many things that we don'tunderstand this is what I mean about the


1:44:33
Speaker 0 :state vector


1:44:35
Speaker 1 :yeah it's I'm trying to always think
 like Gamma understanding in my human brain how do we convert that into howhard is the learning problem here I
 guess is the fundamental question so something that from a hackingperspective this is always comes up
 especially with folks well first the most popular question isthe trolley problem right so that's not
 a sort of a serious problem there are some ethical questions I think thatarise maybe will you want to met you or
 do you think there's any ethical serious ethical questions that we have a

1:45:11
Speaker 0 :solution to the trolley problem Akane
 aye well so there is actually an alert in our code ethical dilemma detectedit's not triggered yeah we don't we
 don't how you have to detect the ethical dilemmas but we're a level two system sowe're going to disengage and leave that
 decision to the human you're such a troll hey no but the trolley problemdeserves to be trolled yeah that's a


1:45:29
Speaker 1 :beautiful answer actually I know I gave


1:45:32
Speaker 0 :it to someone who was like sometimes
 people ask like you asked about the trolley problems like you can have akind of discussion about it like boo you
 get someone who's like really like earnest about it because it's the kindof thing where if you ask a bunch of
 people in an office whether we should use a sequal stack or no sequel stack ifthey're not that technical they have no
 opinion but if you ask them what color they want to paint the office everyonehas an opinion on that and that's why
 the trolley problem is that's it I mean

1:45:56
Speaker 1 :it's a beautiful answer
 yeah we're able to detect the problem and were able to pass it on to the humanyeah I've never never heard anyone say
 it nice escape route okay but proud level - I'm proud level - I love it sothe other thing that people cope you
 know have some concern about with AI in general is hacking so how hard is it doyou think to hack a nataas vehicle
 either through physical access or through the more sort of popular nowthese adversarial examples on the
 sensors be adversarial examples one you

1:46:29
Speaker 0 :want to see some adversarial examples
 that affect humans hmm right oh well there used to be a stop sign here but Iput a black bag over the stop sign and
 then people ran it all right adversarial yeah right like like like there's tonsof human adversarial examples - um the
 question in general about like security if you saw something something just cameout today I'm like there are always such
 high P headlines about like how navigate on autopilot was fooled by a GPS spoofto take an exit right at least that's
 all they could do was take an exit if your car is relying on GPS in order tohave a safe driving policy they're doing
 something if you're relying and this is why v2v issuch a terrible idea
 v2v now relies on both parties getting communication right this is not even soI think of safety security is like a
 special case of safety right safety is like we put a little you know piece ofcaution tape around the hole so that
 people won't walk into it by accident security is I put a 10 foot fence aroundthe hole so you actually physically
 cannot climb into it with barbed wire on the top and stuff right so like ifyou're designing systems that are like
 unreliable they're definitely not secure your car should always do something safeusing its local sensors and then the
 local sensor should be hardwired and then could somebody hack into your canboss and turn your steering wheel on
 your brakes yes but they could do it before commonAI too so let's think out of the box and


1:48:02
Speaker 1 :some things so do you think
 teleoperation has a role in any of this so remotely stepping in and controlling

1:48:14
Speaker 0 :the cars no I think that if safety if
 the safety operation by design requires a constant link to the cars I think itdoesn't work so that's the same argument


1:48:27
Speaker 1 :using for v2i VTV well there's a lot of


1:48:31
Speaker 0 :non safety critical stuff you can do
 with v2 I like v2 I liked v2 I weigh more than V B because Vita I is isalready like I already have internet in
 the car right there's a lot of great stuff you can do with v2 I um like forexample you can well where I already
 have v2 Waze is V die right ways can route me around traffic jams that's agreat example of v2 I mm-hmm and then
 okay the car automatically talks to that same service like improving the

1:48:56
Speaker 1 :experience but it's not a fundamental
 fallback for safety know if any of your

1:49:00
Speaker 0 :if any of your if any of your things
 that require wireless communication are more than qm like have a nozzle ratingyou should you previously said that life


1:49:10
Speaker 1 :is work and then you don't do anything
 to relax so how do you think about hard work well what is it what do you thinkit takes to
 as great things you know there's a lot of people saying that there needs to besome balance you know you need to in
 order to accomplish great things you need to take some time off each ofreflects and so on now and then some
 people are just insanely working burning the candle at both ends how do you thinkabout that I think I was trolling in the


1:49:41
Speaker 0 :Siraj interview when I said that
 off camera right before I spoke a little bit we'd like get out spot this is ajoke right like I do nothing it relaxed
 look where I am I'm at a party right yeah

1:49:53
Speaker 1 :that's true so no of course I I don't um


1:49:55
Speaker 0 :what I say that life is work though I
 mean that like I think that what gives my life meaning is work I don't meanthat every minute of the day you should
 be working I actually think this is not the best way to maximize results I thinkthat if you're working 12 hours a day
 you should be working smarter and not harder

1:50:15
Speaker 1 :well so it gives work gives you meaning
 for some people other source of meaning is personal relationships yeah likefamily and so on
 you've also in that interview of Sirach or does the the trolling mentioned thatone of the things you look forward to in
 the future is AI girlfriends yes so at the topic that I'm all very muchfascinated by not necessarily
 girlfriends but just forming a deep connection with AI what kind of systemdo you imagine when you say AI
 girlfriend whether you were trolling or not know that one I'm very serious about

1:50:48
Speaker 0 :and I'm serious about that on both a
 shallow level and a deep level I think that VR brothels are coming soon and aregonna be really cool it's not cheating
 if it's a robot I see the slogan already but there's I don't know if you've

1:51:04
Speaker 1 :watched it just watched the black mirror
 episode i watch the one year yeah yeah

1:51:11
Speaker 0 :oh the the Ashley - one way da no where


1:51:14
Speaker 1 :there's two friends were having sex with
 each other and mo in the VR game your game it's just two guys but yeah one ofthem was was a female and yeah there's
 another mind-blowing concept that in VR you don't have to be the form you can beto animals having sex
 weird I mean I'll see you I said the

1:51:37
Speaker 0 :software Maps the nerve endings right
 yeah yeah they they sweep a lot of the

1:51:41
Speaker 1 :fascinating really difficult technical
 challenges under the rock like assuming it's possible to do the mapping of thenerve endings then I wish yeah I saw


1:51:51
Speaker 0 :that the way they did it with a little
 like stim unit on the head that'd be amazing so wanna know on a shallow levellike you could set up like almost a
 brothel with like real dolls and oculus quests right some good software I thinkit vehicle novelty experience you know
 on a deeper like emotional level I mean yeah I would really like to fall in lovewith with with the machine do you see


1:52:19
Speaker 1 :yourself having a long-term relationship
 of the kind monogamous relationship that we have now with a robot with a a AIsystem even not even just the robot so I


1:52:34
Speaker 0 :think about maybe my ideal future when I
 was fifteen I read eliezer yudkowsky early writings mmm-hmmon the singularity and like that AI is
 going to surpass human intelligence massively he made some Moore's law basedpredictions that I mostly agree with and
 then I really struggled for the next couple years of my life like why shouldI even bother to learn anything it's all
 gonna be meaningless when the machines show up right maybe maybe when I wasthat young I was still a little bit more
 pure and really like clung to that and I'm like wow the machines ain't here yetyou know and I seem to be pretty good at
 this stuff let's uh let's try my best you know likewhat's the worst that happens but the
 best possible future I see is me sort of merging with the Machine and the waythat I personify this is in a long-term
 monogamous relationship with a machine oh you don't think there's room for

1:53:33
Speaker 1 :another human in your life if you really
 truly merge with another machine I mean

1:53:39
Speaker 0 :I see merging I see like the best
 interface to my brain is like the same relationship and to merge with an AIright
 does that merging feel like I see yeah I've seen couples who've been togetherfor a long time and like I almost think
 of them as one person like couples who spend all their time together and that's

1:54:01
Speaker 1 :that's how you're actually putting what
 does that merging actually looks like it's not just a nice channel like a lotof people imagine it's just an efficient
 link search link to Wikipedia or something I don't believe in that butit's more you're saying that there's the
 same kind of the same kind of relationship you have one other humanthat's a deep relationship is that's
 what merging looks like that's that's pretty uh I don't believe that link is

1:54:25
Speaker 0 :possible um I think that that link so
 you're like oh me to download Wikipedia right to my brain yeah my reading speedis not limited by my eyes my reading
 speed is limited by my inner processing locally and to like bootstrap thatsounds kind of unclear how to do it and
 horrify but if I am with somebody and I'll use a somebody who is making asuper sophisticated model of me and then
 running simulations on that model I'm not gonna get into the question whetherthe simulations are conscious or not I
 don't really want to know what it's doingum but using those simulations to play
 out hypothetical futures for me deciding what things to say to me to guide mealong a path and that's how I envision
 it

1:55:09
Speaker 1 :so on that path to AI of superhuman
 level intelligence you've mentioned that you believe in the singularity thatsingularity is coming yeah again could
 be trolling could be not could be part I'm all trolling his truth in it I don't

1:55:23
Speaker 0 :know what that means anymore what is the
 singularity yeah so that's that's really

1:55:25
Speaker 1 :the question how many years do you think
 before the singularity what form do you think it will take does that meanfundamental shifts and capabilities of
 AI does it mean some other kind of ideas

1:55:39
Speaker 0 :um maybe this is just my roots but so I
 can buy a human beings worth of compute for like a million bucks that I it'sabout one TPU pod v3 I want like I think
 they claim a hundred peda flops that's being generous I think humans areactually more like twenty so that's like
 five humans that's pretty good Google needs to sell their teepees umbut I could buy I could buy I could buy
 GPUs I could buy a stack of like by 1080 tea eyes build data center full of themfour million box I can get a human worth
 of compute but when you look at the total number of flops in the world whenyou look at human flops which goes up
 very very slowly with the population and machine flops which goes upexponentially but it's still nowhere
 near I think that's the key thing to talk about when the singularity happenedwhen most flops in the world are silicon
 and not biological that's kind of the crossing point like they are now thedominant species on the planet and just


1:56:36
Speaker 1 :looking at how technology is progressing
 when do you think that could possibly happenyou think go to happen in your lifetime
 oh yeah definitely my lifetime I've done

1:56:42
Speaker 0 :the math I like 2038 because it's the
 UNIX timestamp rollover yeah beautifully

1:56:49
Speaker 1 :put
 so you've you said that the meaning of life has to win if you look five yearsinto the future what does winning look
 like so

1:57:02
Speaker 0 :[Music]
 hi there's a lot of I can go into like technical depth to what I mean by thatto win um it may not mean I was
 criticized for that in the comments like doesn't this guy want to like save thepenguins in Antarctica or like you know
 listen to what I'm saying I'm not talking about like I have a yacht orsomething I am an agent I am put into
 this world and I don't really know what my purpose is but if you're areinforcement if you're if you're an
 intelligent agent and you're put into a world what is the ideal thing to do wellthe ideal thing mathematically you go
 back to like Schmitt Hoover theories about this is to build a compressivemodel of the world to build a maximally
 compressive to explore the world such that your exploration function maximizesthe derivative of compression of the
 past mid Hoover has a paper about this and like I took that kind of as like apersonal goal function so what I mean to
 win I mean like maybe maybe this is religious but like I think that in thefuture I might be given a real purpose
 or I may decide this purpose myself and then at that point now I know what thegame is and I know how to win I think
 right now I'm still just trying to figure out what the game is but once Iknow so you have you have imperfect


1:58:23
Speaker 1 :information you have a lot of
 uncertainty about the reward function and you're discovering it exactly thepurpose is that's that's the better way


1:58:31
Speaker 0 :

1:58:32
Speaker 1 :to put it the purpose is to maximize it
 while you have it a lot of uncertainty around it and you're both reducing theuncertainty and maximizing at the same
 time yeah and so that's at the technical level what is the if you believe in the

1:58:45
Speaker 0 :universal prior yeah
 what is the universal reward function that's the better way to put it so that

1:58:51
Speaker 1 :when it's interesting I think I speak
 for everyone in saying that I wonder what that reward function is for you andI look forward to seeing that in five
 years in ten years I think a lot of people who do myself right and cheeringyou on man so I'm I'm a happy you exist
 and I wish you the best of luck thanks for talking today man
